<p>The town of Ballingoole has always
awakened a certain amount of respectful
surprise in the minds of strangers; it is
so amazingly unlike its name! According
to tourists who wish to pay it an
extravagant compliment, it actually recalls
a fine old English village, and, indeed, in
its palmy days, Ballingoole would not
have considered itself at all flattered by
the comparison. Fifty years ago it was
the stronghold of one of the most rigidly
exclusive circles in the south of Ireland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span></p>

<p>The wide hilly street was lined by
noble and imposing residences, that looked
as if they had quitted country parks and
pleasure grounds, and flocked together
for company; liberally planned gardens—celebrated
for fruit and roses—sloped away
from French windows at the rear of these
mansions, to the very brink of a slow,
brown canal—once glorified by fly boats,
galloping teams and gay passengers, but
now abandoned to lethargic barges, bearing
freights of turf and manure. In the
good old days the town was peopled by
retired officers (naval and military),
wealthy widows, and well-born spinsters,
and actually numbered a baronet, and the
brother of a viscount among its tenants.</p>

<p>There was an extensive collection of
the best society in Ballingoole in former
times; whist parties—concluding with
very potent negus, goloshes and lanterns—substantial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
dinners, with weighty joints,
strawberry fêtes, and hunt breakfasts, were
of common occurrence. To tell the truth,
“the town” was somewhat exclusive, and
secretly turned up its nose at most of the
county folk; but now, alas! times were
changed, and the county turned up its
nose at the town.</p>

<p>As years went on, ancient inhabitants
who remembered the illuminations after
Waterloo, and told anecdotes of George
the Fourth, had been gradually gathered
to their family vaults, and there was no
inducement for other gentry to take their
places. Some of the finest houses were
let in tenements, and displayed small
washings fluttering from upper windows.
Several stood empty, with rusty area-railings,
and shattered panes. Over the
late abode of a baronet, hung three
weather-beaten golden balls, and the mansion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
in which Mrs. General Moriarty once
held her famous routs and card parties,
thinks itself very lucky to be no worse
than the police barrack!</p>

<p>Yes, the big houses now merge into
shops, the shops into one-storeyed cottages,
and the cottages into squat mud
hovels, at the foot of the hill, down
which Ballingoole has been going in more
ways than one, for many years past. At
the head of the street, two residences are
still let to genteel tenants. Mrs. Finny,
a doctor’s widow, and her daughter; and
Miss Dopping, an eccentric old maid,
occupy the best houses in the place, for
the traditional old song. This is a consideration
with Mrs. Finny, a lady with a
limited income; but Miss Dopping is rich,
and could afford herself a house in Park
Lane, if so disposed. She is the last of
her family, the sole legatee of more than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
one comfortable fortune, but no one would
suppose it from her appearance, as she
stalks down the street, tall, gaunt and
shabby. Although upwards of seventy
years of age, she is as erect as a lamp-post,
having been reared in the great
back-board period; and, despite her rusty
black bonnet, frieze cloak, and ridiculous
purple woollen gloves, there is no mistaking
her for anything but a lady.</p>

<p>It was a soft November afternoon; the
hedges were not yet quite bare; the
haws—signs of a hard winter—clustered
in thick red bunches, and yellow leaves,
from overhanging beeches, fluttered reluctantly
into the muddy road. There
was not a sound to be heard in this still
country spot, save the distant rattle of
an ass’s car, and the clump of Miss Dopping’s
umbrella, as she trudged along a
foot-path, but few degrees drier than the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
highway, <i>en route</i> to pay her quarterly
visit of ceremony, to her neighbour, Mrs.
Redmond of Noone.</p>

<p>Another half mile of the greasy foot-path,
and a lofty wall, topped with firs,
comes into view, also a pair of big iron
gates (once green), also a winding avenue—which
is very green indeed—lined with
dripping trees and over-grown laurels. In
answer to a scream of “gate” in Miss
Dopping’s cracked falsetto, a fat old
woman, with a shawl over her head and
a key on her finger, came waddling out
of the lodge, and said as she curtseyed
profoundly:</p>

<p>“Good evening to you, me lady—a
fine, soft day.”</p>

<p>“And how are you, Juggy?” enquired
Miss Dopping, with a keen glance into
Juggy’s round, red face.</p>

<p>“Faix, but poorly, me lady. I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
had a cruel turn of them rheumatics;
they catches me here, and here, and here”—clutching
her elbows, back and knees,
to illustrate her sufferings. “I feel as if
I was being crucified, like the saints and
martyrs, but a good flannel petticoat
would put the life in me,” and she stared
significantly at her interlocutor.</p>

<p>“It’s only the damp weather—I feel it
myself,” returned Miss Dopping unsympathetically.
“Any one above?” pointing
up the avenue with her notable umbrella—an
immense alpaca construction of distended
proportions, likewise remarkable
for a huge ivory handle, representing
Death’s head. When remonstrated with
upon the subject of its size and age, its
owner invariably replied:</p>

<p>“It was good enough for my mother,
and is good enough for me, and will wear
out fifty of your nasty flimsy gimcracks.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, me lady, I am afther opening
the gate for Mrs. Finny and Miss Maria.”</p>

<p>Miss Dopping ejaculated something inaudible,
and looked over her shoulder, as
if she had a mind to retreat.</p>

<p>“You may as well go up, ma’am,”
urged Juggy, possibly divining her
thoughts, “since you <i>are</i> so far. They
are in it a good hour or more, and bid
to be going soon, for there’s no tay, or
cake and wine offered <i>these</i> times!”</p>

<p>“Now what are they doing out here?”
muttered the old lady to herself, as she
plodded up the avenue. “They were
here three days ago to my certain knowledge.”</p>

<p>“Oh! so that’s you, Pat?” to a
shock-haired urchin, with bare red legs,
who burst though the laurels, with a
grin of expectation on his dirty little
keen face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p>“Let me see,” diving into her pocket
as she spoke, “were you at school to-day?”</p>

<p>“Begorra, I was, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“Then spell Ballingoole?”</p>

<p>Pat became painfully red, and his grin
faded.</p>

<p>“Well, well, then never mind,” producing
a little knitted jug, containing
coppers, and placing three pennies in
his ready palm—</p>

<p>“Have you been out dark fowling
since?”</p>

<p>“No, ma’am,” was his reply,—but he
lied unto her.</p>

<p>“Because if you ever do such a
cruel thing again, as blazing lanterns
into poor birds’ eyes, and knocking
them down with sticks, you have seen
the last of my coppers, as sure as my
name is Sarah Dopping; so mind <i>that</i>,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
and with an emphatic thump of her
umbrella, she tramped on.</p>

<p>The avenue at Noone was not imposingly
long, and in a few minutes
Miss Dopping had turned the corner,
and was almost at the hall door.</p>

<p>Noone House was a straggling building,
with no pretensions to beauty,
dignity, or even antiquity—merely a
big, grey mansion, with three rows of
windows, and a glass porch, overlooking
a low flat demesne, fringed with
rows of dreary fir-trees. The back of
Noone was flanked by a fine, old,
seasoned garden, and many acres of
worthless woods, which swarmed with
rabbits. The land was poor and marshy—not
to say boggy—neither useful nor
ornamental, and the rabbits were an important
item in Mrs. Redmond’s income.
She was the widow of an idle Irish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
gentleman, with a magnificent pedigree
and a meagre fortune, who had departed
this life, leaving her two hundred a year
and one fair daughter—and she had endeavoured
to make the most of both.
At eighteen, Isabel Redmond was a
remarkably handsome girl, the cynosure
of many eyes, as she and her mother
paraded about in showy costumes, to the
strains of a seaside band. She was unusually
lively: she could sing pretty little
French songs, and act and dance in a
sprightly manner, and was taken up, and
asked about, by discriminating matrons—with
no unmarried daughters—and more
than once had been upon the brink of
an enviable match. Mrs. Redmond was
ambitious, and her anticipations in the
shape of a son-in-law modestly stopped
just short of royalty. She strained every
nerve—and she was an energetic woman—to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
dress her idol with fitting display,
and to carry her into the most popular
haunts of men (eligible men). Garrison
towns, where cavalry were quartered,
French watering places, and German spas,
affected by rich and gouty bachelors,
were visited in turn by Mrs. and Miss
Redmond. These visits were brilliant, if
brief; they generally made some gay,
agreeable acquaintances—“birds of passage”
like themselves, who voted them
charming, and loudly regretted their departure—as
did also their too trustful
tradespeople, for Mrs. Redmond had a
bad memory for small bills. She was
an indefatigable chaperon, the most industrious
and intriguing of her sex;
and no galley slave, toiling at his oar,
under the blazing Mediterranean sun,
worked harder than she did at the
business—the vital business—of keeping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
up appearances, and “getting Isabella
settled.”</p>

<p>To say that the army list, the county
families, and the peerage, were at her
fingers’ ends, may give some faint idea
of her reading. As to writing, she was
an untiring scribe, and deservedly merited
a private secretary; corresponding with
important acquaintances, with distant,
aged, and wealthy connections, plying all
with graceful, flattering letters, ditto
photographs of Belle, and expensive
Christmas cards; snatching ravenously at
vague invitations; following up marching
regiments, and anxiously courting the
female relatives of rich young men.
After ten years of knocking about Vanity
Fair, the most pushing and plausible of
vendors, her wares were no longer in
their first freshness, and alas! still unsold;
for Miss Isabel, though beautiful,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
was said to have a cold heart, a hot
temper, and a head as empty as her
purse. Connections had died, and made
no sign. Correspondents were dumb;
promising partners of Belle’s had revoked
miserably and fled; fine acquaintances
averted their eyes from what they considered
a shabby old sponge, with a
<i>passée</i> daughter, and the poor-house loomed
immediately in her foreground. Mrs. Redmond
was at the end of her credit and
resources, and struggling in an angry sea
of debt, when Providence threw her a
plank. Old Brian Redmond, one of her
many irons in the fire, having quarrelled
with all his near relatives, departed this
life, leaving (to spite the proverbially
hated heir-at-law) Noone House and lands
“to the pleasant widow woman with the
pretty daughter”—whom by the way he
had never seen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span></p>

<p>Joy! Joy! one of the widow woman’s
many sprats had caught a salmon at
last!</p>

<p>Naturally she was enchanted at her
good fortune, but—there is always a
but. The bequest was in Ireland, the
best country in the world to live out of,
in her opinion, and she was obliged to
agree to two stipulations before she could
call Noone her own. In the first place,
she must guarantee to reside on the premises,
and, secondly, she must share her
home with, and be “a mother” to, Brian
Redmond’s orphan grand-niece—a relative
to whom he bequeathed a legacy of two
hundred pounds a year. If Mrs. Redmond
objected to these clauses, she had the
remedy in her own hands, and Noone
passed on to another remote connection,
one of the Redmonds of Ballyredmond—a
childless, rich, old man. Mrs. Redmond<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
hated the conditions of the will, but she
was socially and financially bankrupt;
better to exist in Ireland, than to starve
in England; her health was bad, her
energy abated, and after wearying the
inmates of a cheap London boarding-house,
with pompous boastings of “my
place in Ireland,” “my shooting,” “my
Irish property,” went over, and entered
into her kingdom, with a curious mixture
of satisfaction and disgust. She had now
been residing on her own acres for three
years, saving and scraping with extraordinary
enjoyment, ignoring ancient debts,
and discovering a fresh and novel interest
in leasing the rabbit warrens, selling
fruit, fowl and turf, keeping few servants,
no equipages, and finding her excitements
in small country gossip, feuds with the
butcher, and startling domestic economies.
There was also old Brian’s other legacy—Elizabeth,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
or Betty, Redmond, with
her two hundred pounds a year, which
her self-styled “Aunt” coolly appropriated
for her board and lodging, having removed
her from school when she was
seventeen years of age, believing that she
could find a more excellent use at home
for Betty and her money—in which belief
the astute old lady was subsequently
most fully justified. But enough of the
inmates of Noone. For all this time we
are keeping Miss Dopping shivering on
its hall door steps. At first she rang
gently, but firmly. After a pause, firmly,
but not gently. Finally, a wild passionate
peal; and then the distant slamming
of doors, and a heavy deliberate footfall
came in answer to her summons.</p>

<p>Miss Dopping was unmistakably put
out, because there had been a delay in
letting her in, and when the servant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
volunteered to part her and her umbrella,
she was, to say the least of it, a little
short in her manner. The old lady was
presently ushered into a drawing-room,
cold as a vault. From an adjoining
apartment, the babble of female tongues
and shrill laughter was distinctly audible;
in a few minutes she was requested to
“step into the study,” and here she discovered
Mrs. and Miss Redmond, and
Mrs. and Miss Finny, disposed in four
arm-chairs, round a comfortable turf fire.</p>

<p>“Dear me, Miss Dopping!” exclaimed
her hostess, rising with an effort from
the depths of a low seat. “This is indeed
an unexpected pleasure. It is ages
since I have seen you! Do come near
the fire. Ah, I forgot, you are not one
of its worshippers, like me. I would
rather dispense with my dinner than my
fire!”</p>

<p>“You would not say that, if you had
tried it,” rejoined Miss Dopping, seating
herself bolt upright, and gazing
sharply around her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Redmond shook her head from
side to side, like a great pendulum, and
leant back in her chair, and crossed her
arms over her extensive waist. She was
a majestic matron, dressed in black,
with heavy regular features, little hard
yellowish eyes, and a deliberate delivery.
Her thick grey hair was covered with
a black cap, and her plump hands with
a pair of soiled grey kid gloves, minus
their finger-tops.</p>

<p>Isabel or Belle—“Belle and the
Dragon” were the names by which she
and her mother were known in certain
profane circles—lounged in an easy attitude
in a basket chair, holding an
<i>Irish Times</i> between her face and the
fire. It was a handsome face, and she
did well to protect it. Belle was a
young lady of, shall we say, seven and
twenty?—at any rate she says so herself,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
and looks no more, and of course
every woman is the age she looks—with
a pair of dangerous black eyes,
straight black brows, a short upper lip,
a pointed chin, and a sufficient supply
of wavy dark hair. A small, graceful
figure and a slender foot, were not the
least of her attractions. But at present,
neither figure nor foot are seen to any
advantage, for she wears a dilapidated
old red tea-gown, with ragged laces
and stained front, and a pair of
extremely <i>passée</i> slippers. In fact
Belle’s toilette must not be too closely
scanned.</p>

<p>“Now, don’t look at me! Don’t look
at me,” she said, gesticulating with
much animation, and playfully holding
the newspaper between Miss Dopping
and herself. “I know I am an awful
object; but in winter, I never adorn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
myself unless I am going out—there is
no one to dress for!”</p>

<p>“No <i>men</i>, you mean,” amended Miss
Dopping, severely.</p>

<p>“Yes, I do. There is not a man at
this side of Ballingoole, except Major
Malone and Dr. Doran.”</p>

<p>“And <i>he</i> is an old woman,” observed
Miss Finny tartly—but naturally the
daughter of the late practitioner had
but scant mercy on her father’s successor.</p>

<p>“You are a great visitor these times,
Mrs. Finny,” remarked Miss Dopping,
pointedly.</p>

<p>“Well, dear, just once in a way, you
know,” returned Mrs. Finny apologetically.
“Only just once in a way.”</p>

<p>She was a meek little lady, with a
pretty, faded face, and a plaintive whine
in her voice, totally different from her
tall, masculine-looking daughter, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
had hard features, a square jaw, and a
mouth like the slit of a letter-box—and
in that mouth a renowned and dreaded
tongue—Maria Finny was about forty-five
years of age, embittered against all
mankind, and the implacable enemy of
the young and well-favoured of her own
sex. Poor Maria! In her life there
had been but little sunshine, and not
one ray of love, or the shadow of a
lover. A long monotonous tale without
a plot, without a hero—she had not even
a hobby or a pet, she did not read,
paint or write; she superintended the
scanty <i>ménage</i>, she ruled her mother,
and lived meagrely and discontentedly,
an aggrieved, soured woman, with an
unfulfilled youth, and a bleak, hopeless
future; and yet Maria had ten times
more capacity for passionate, unselfish
love than brilliant Belle Redmond with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
her enchanting smile and sympathetic
eyes. Perhaps, if Maria’s upper lip had
been half an inch shorter, if her mouth
had been of more reasonable dimensions,
it might have made a vast difference in
her destiny—who knows?</p>

<p>“We thought we would just look in
as we were passing,” she said, continuing
her mother’s explanation, “and tell
Mrs. Redmond the news.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” broke in Mrs. Redmond, with
unusual animation. “There is a stir in
town, haven’t you heard?”</p>

<p>“That Peter Brock’s daughter is going
to America after all? Of course I
know <i>that</i>,” replied Miss Dopping contemptuously.</p>

<p>“Not at all,” said Maria. “Far finer
news than about Mary Brock. I met
Mrs. Malone driving herself into town
in the donkey car; she seemed quite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
excited, and her face all flushed in
patches. She had just had a telegram;
her son, Mr. Holroyd, has come home
from India on sick leave, and he has
not given her any time to think it over,
for he arrives to-night.”</p>

<p>“Delightful!” ejaculated Belle, dropping
her paper, and clapping her hands
softly.</p>

<p>“He has not been at Bridgetstown
these five years, and then only for a
few days,” remarked Mrs. Finny. “He
and the Major don’t get on. Nor stable
their horses together.”</p>

<p>“And no wonder,” retorted Maria
forcibly. “Young Holroyd is a gentleman,
and Major Malone is a gambling,
greedy, selfish, old bully, and a nice
respectable example for his son, Denis,
spending half his time on race-courses,
betting away every penny, and leaving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
his family paupers. It’s no wonder Mrs.
Malone’s hair falls out, and she looks so
heart-broken! She only keeps three
servants now, and sells the vegetables
and fruit, and the buttermilk, a penny
a can. To my certain knowledge, she
has had that brown bonnet this three
years, and Cuckoo’s boots are a shame
and a disgrace.”</p>

<p>“At any rate, she has only herself to
thank,” returned Mrs. Redmond, leaning
still further back in her chair, and
placing two capacious slippers on the
fender, where they had a fairly prominent
effect.</p>

<p>Seeing Miss Finny’s eyes fastened on
them, she said: “Well, yes, Maria, I
am not ashamed of them! My London
bootmaker declared that it was a real
pleasure to see a foot of a fine natural
size! I know you pride yourself on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
wearing threes, but I call your feet disjointed
deformities. However, about Mrs.
Malone. Holroyd left her well off, a
pretty widow, with one little boy; she
might have left well alone, instead of
marrying a good-for-nothing half-pay
major.”</p>

<p>“But you know, dear, he had a
splendid property then,” protested Mrs.
Finny, in a piteous tone.</p>

<p>“He has no splendid property now,”
said Maria sharply; “there will not be
an acre for Denis, and serve him right;
an idle young scamp, it’s my belief he
will never pass for the medical.”</p>

<p>“He is the apple of his mother’s
eye,” drawled Mrs. Redmond. “She
slaves for him, and screws for him,
and keeps all his scrapes from the
Major.”</p>

<p>“And the Major’s scrapes from her son<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
George,” supplemented Maria, with a disagreeable
giggle.</p>

<p>“Yes, the Major is a sore trial to all
that are about him,” resumed Mrs. Redmond.
“No one is to spend but himself.
He must have good dinners and cigars
and wine——”</p>

<p>“Whisky, you mean,” interrupted Maria
with a snort.</p>

<p>“Well, whisky,” impatiently, “and a
high dogcart, and curly-brimmed hats
and patent-leather boots, but everyone
else may live on potatoes and salt, and
slave for him like niggers, or he roars
like a mad tiger, and no one dare say a
word.”</p>

<p>“I believe George Holroyd said a good
many words to him, the last time he was
here,” replied Maria, expressively.</p>

<p>“Yes, and he took it out of George
Holroyd’s mother, as soon as his back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
was turned,” whined Mrs. Finny—who
always spoke as if she was on the verge
of tears—“and he has spent every penny
of her fortune. I can’t think how they
live at all; the poor things!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Holroyd helps them,” explained
Mrs. Redmond. “Jane Bolland,
at the Post Office, has often seen his
cheques; he has a good private income,
besides his pay.”</p>

<p>“Miss Dopping,” said Belle, suddenly
addressing the old lady, who sat in grim,
observant silence, with her purple gloves,
exactly crossed on the Death’s-head
handle of her umbrella; “you are the
oldest inhabitant, and know everything;
do tell us all about Mr. Holroyd.”</p>

<p>“Stuff and nonsense, Isabella! you are
taking me for Jane Bolland. Go to her;
<i>she</i> will tell you how many shirts he has
to his back, how many cigars he smokes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
and how much he owes his tailor; only
give her time.”</p>

<p>“No, no, I am not thinking of Jane.
I want you to tell me—I mean to tell
us—what he has a year.”</p>

<p>“How should <i>I</i> know?” snarled Miss
Dopping.</p>

<p>“A thousand?” in a coaxing tone.</p>

<p>“Have <i>you</i> a thousand?” very gruffly.</p>

<p>“But indeed, dear, he must have something
handsome,” pleaded Mrs. Finny, “for
he keeps polo ponies and racing ponies
in India, and has been very kind to his
mother.”</p>

<p>“Now, Miss Dopping,” urged Belle
boldly, “do be nice to me, do tell me all
about him. I am dying to see him.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be bound you are!” returned the
old lady ferociously.</p>

<p>“How old is he?” continued her undaunted
questioner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span></p>

<p>“Not much younger than you are yourself,”
was the brutal reply, “within a
year or so of thirty.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you dear old thing!” cried Belle,
with a somewhat dangerous gleam in her
eye, but a playful wave of her paper,
“you always must have your little joke.”</p>

<p>Miss Dopping detested Belle’s familiarities;
she would almost as soon have had
her nose pulled as be called “a dear old
thing.” She was on the verge of some
savage retort, when Mrs. Finny, who was
still romantic, exclaimed pathetically:
“He is so handsome in his photograph,
so dark and soldierly looking—just a
darling fellow.”</p>

<p>“Then he does not take after his dear
mamma,” sneered Maria. “She is so pale
and faded, she always reminds <i>me</i> of a
white rat.”</p>

<p>“She has had enough to fade her, poor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
soul,” said Mrs. Redmond. “She has
suffered for her folly. Now I may tell
you, without vanity, that in my day, I
was a young woman of remarkable personal
attractions. I was quite a toast,
and I was called the ‘Lily of Lippendale.’”
(It required a strong effort of the
imagination to suppose that this bulky old
lady, with a very sallow complexion, could
ever have been the Lily of anywhere.) “I
had poems written about me, and people
used to wait outside our house to see me
pass, and yet, though quite a girlish widow,
I would never listen to a second suitor.”</p>

<p>Here Miss Finny sniffed incredulously,
and her mother said: “I wonder if Mr.
Holroyd will see many changes.”</p>

<p>“To be sure he will,” snapped Maria;
“why wouldn’t he? He will see the
Major redder and stouter, his mother
whiter and thinner, Cuckoo as ugly as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
one of her own young namesakes, and
Denis, an idle ne’er-do-weel, sponging on
his family, and playing spoil five in the
stables.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you find it very cold over
there?” screamed Miss Dopping, suddenly
addressing a figure in a distant
window.</p>

<p>A girl who was ripping some article
of dress by the fading daylight, looked
up and glanced interrogatively at Mrs.
Redmond.</p>

<p>“Yes, Betty, my darling, I am sure
you cannot see any longer; you must be
perished; come to the fire.”</p>

<p>In answer to this invitation, Betty
approached and stretched a pair of thin
red hands towards the blaze. She was
tall and slender, and had a low, broad
forehead, delicate features, and quantities
of bright brown hair. To a superficial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
observer, she was merely a gaunt, pale,
shabby girl, who looked both cold and
cross, and not to be named in the same
year with our pretty, sparkling Belle, who
was toasting her toes so comfortably on
the fender. But when the sun lit up the
golden tints of her magnificent hair;
when the wind gave her white cheeks a
wild rose tinge; when a smile illuminated
her fathomless grey eyes, Betty, too, had
her admirers.</p>

<p>“Mr. Holroyd will be quite a catch,”
remarked Mrs. Redmond, rubbing her
hands complacently, “and those Wilde
girls will be sure to ask him over, although
they have not called on his mother
for years. He will show a <i>very</i> poor
spirit if he goes near them; they never
ask anyone inside their house except young
men; they are always having ‘friends of
their brothers,’ as they call them, to stay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
at Mantrap Hall, as you have named it,
Maria; and a capital name it is.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if he sings?” said Belle
meditatively.</p>

<p>“Like his mother,” exclaimed Maria,
casting up her eyes to the ceiling.</p>

<p>“I hope <i>not</i>, poor unfortunate woman!
her singing reminds me of a dog baying
at the moon. She ought to be muzzled
at the piano.”</p>

<p>Miss Dopping looked as if she thought
some one else might as well be muzzled
too!</p>

<p>“Mother,” continued Belle, “we really
must have the piano tuned, and must
make some smart aprons and caps for
Eliza. I shall write to Madame Rosalie
by to-night’s post. I have not a single
decent dress, neither have you.”</p>

<p>“What a stir, and what a fuss about
one very ordinary young man!” growled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
Miss Dopping. “After all he may be
engaged to some girl in India!”</p>

<p>“He may,” agreed Belle, “but, at
any rate, he is not ordinary, is he,
Maria?” turning a look of tragic appeal
on Miss Finny, “you have seen
him?”</p>

<p>“Yes, years ago; he was nothing very
remarkable; he had nice eyes and a good
figure, and looked like a gentleman, which
is more than we can say for his step-brother,
Denis.”</p>

<p>Maria’s verdict was accepted in solemn
affirmative silence, and, after a little desultory
conversation on a less absorbing
topic than Mr. Holroyd, the Finnys and
Miss Dopping departed into the darkness
of a chill November afternoon at the
thirsty hour of five o’clock.</p>

<p>As they poked their way down the
greasy avenue, Maria exclaimed: “What<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
a mean old woman! She had not the
heart to offer us a cup of tea. Mark my
words, mother, Belle Redmond will do
her best to catch George Holroyd.”</p>

<p>“Why? What makes you say that,
dearie?”</p>

<p>“Why? a child could tell you, and
give you twenty reasons,” said Miss
Finny contemptuously. “She hates
Noone, and would marry a tinker, to get
away from it. She is not as young as
she was, and is desperately afraid of
being an old maid. She adores officers,
and would give ten years of her life to
go to India. Mr. Holroyd is in the
army; his regiment is in India; he has
private means, and is so to speak ‘made
to her hand;’ she will do all in her
power to marry him. What do you say,
Miss Dopping?”</p>

<p>“I say that I hope the Lord will deliver<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
him,” replied the old lady very
piously.</p>

<p>“Amen!” responded Maria Finny,
with the fervency of a prayer.</p>

<p>Between Bridgetstown and Noone lay
Ballingoole, and the reasonable visiting
distance of one Irish mile. Bridgetstown
was a great, staring white house, with
two low wings, that stood familiarly close
to the road, although screened from the
vulgar gaze by a high hedge of impenetrable
laurels.</p>

<p>According to Major Malone, “the front
of the house was at the back,” by which
truly Irish statement, he meant that all
the principal apartments opened south,
into a delightful pleasure-ground, shaded
by fine old trees, brilliant with flowers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
and bounded by the grey walls of a
celebrated garden. No one, driving up
to the bleak and rather mean entrance,
would believe that the mere act of
walking across a hall could create such
a total transformation of aspect. It was
like passing from winter into summer,
and exchanging the shores of the White
Sea for the Mediterranean. The Bridgetstown
pleasure-ground was a notorious
sun-trap, the rendezvous of half the bees
in the Barony, and the ruination of
any delicate complexion. Flowers that
drooped and died elsewhere, here blazed
forth in flaunting profusion; invalid cuttings
sprang to health at once, and the
frail, fastidious, “Marechal Niel” and
“Cloth of Gold,” draped the garden
entrance as with a yellow mantle.
Bridgetstown was a curious anomaly.
The great white mansion was out of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
place by the roadside, and the pretty
demesne that lay to the right of a long
range of walls (enclosing grounds and
stable-yards) looked empty and houseless.
A noble avenue of limes ran parallel to
the garden, and led to no place in particular,
and everywhere in general. It
seemed as if the house had had a violent
quarrel with the park and avenue, and
was on the point of quitting the premises.
The farms belonging to the property
were also scattered over the country in
the most inconvenient directions, but
Major Malone, in his high, red-wheeled
dog-cart, made a virtue of inspecting
them very frequently; his care-takers
could have told another tale! When his
credulous wife supposed him to be
making a martyr of himself, and superintending
ploughing, hay-making or threshing,
he was generally attending some race<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
or coursing meeting, or framing himself
in the bow window of the Kildare Street
Club.</p>

<p>Enough of the exterior of Bridgetstown.
It is a raw November night; a penetrating
drizzle is descending; let us go inside,
and join the family at dinner.</p>

<p>A glance is sufficient to show that
the house was built in the days when
money was no object with the Malones,
and when there was no struggling for
cheap effect. The balustrades are carved
oak; the doors solid mahogany; the
marble chimneypieces works of Italian
art; the furniture, plate, and china were
all of the best of their kind, a hundred
years ago. True, the china is now
cracked; the plate somewhat battered;
the mahogany a good deal scratched;
the chintz and brocade faded; but nevertheless
there is an air of respectability,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
a glimmer of the light of other days,
lingering about the premises, that fails
not to impress all strangers. The dining-room
is large and lofty, papered with a
dismal flock paper, the very touch of
which thrills one to the tips of one’s
finger nails; the three windows are
decently draped in dark moreen curtains;
a fine fire blazes up the chimney, in
front of which blinks “Boozle,” a monstrous
red tom cat, the dearly beloved
<i>protégé</i> of Major Malone—a cat with a
strong individuality, and considerable
sporting rights as to rabbits and young
game. Even the attractive aroma of a
hot roast sirloin, does not entice him from
the hearthrug—for he has eaten, and is
filled with a prime young cock pheasant,
and prefers his comfortable and contemplative
attitude beside the fender.</p>

<p>The dinner table is square, and is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
lighted up with silver branch candlesticks;
the forks and spoons are silver,
too; also the dish covers, wine coolers,
and flagons; the tumblers are real cut
glass, and the china mostly old Worcester,
though here and there eked out with a
terrible blue and white Delft plate.
There are no flowers to be seen, nor any
attempt at table decoration, unless six
rather greasy dinner mats come under
that denomination. Mrs. Malone, who is
head cook, chief butler, upper housemaid,
and valet, has no time for such details,
and in a family where the master is particular
about his shirts, his boots, and,
above all, his dinner, and there is a large
house to be kept habitable, cows to milk,
the door to answer, lamps, fires, and
plate to be attended to, the mistress of
but three servants must put her shoulder
to the wheel. This mistress is a woman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
of about eight and forty, and looks much
older. She is thin and colourless, and
her faded fair hair displays a very wide
parting; her blue eyes are timid to
abjectness, her mouth has a pitiful droop,
and her once pretty hands are coarse and
scarred with manual labour; she wears a
black (cotton) velvet body, and a large
pink topaz brooch and earrings, in order
to look smart in the eyes of her eldest
son. Poor Lucy Holroyd! you thought
you had taken a fresh lease of happiness
when you married bluff, handsome, hearty
Major Malone. Little did you guess that
you were offering your slender shoulders
to a pitiless old man of the sea. Major
Malone is still bluff, but no longer either
hearty or handsome; his head is bald,
but he endeavours to disguise the miserable
truth, by arranging an effeminately long
lock round and round his bare poll, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
affixing it thereto with bandoline—or, it
may be, glue. Occasionally, in a high
wind, or in a moment of intense agitation,
this lock has been known to come down,
and float wildly in the breeze, like a
demented pigtail. To the Major “this
lock is wondrous fair,” and his most
cherished vanity, and he has the impudence
to discourse of “bald old fogies” with contemptuous
commiseration. He is dressed
in evening clothes, with much care and
precision; wears a flower in his button-hole,
and a diamond in his shirt, and is
altogether a superior being to his shabby
wife and daughter. As he deftly carves
the sirloin before him, we get an inkling
of his true character. For whom are those
three large slices from the undercut that
he so artfully sets aside, to soak in the
gravy? The remainder he apportions with
an impartial hand, and when the undercut<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
is finished, he turns over the joint, and
helps his customers from the less toothsome
portion, but he does not dream of
sharing those three appetising morsels
reserved for his own most particular
palate, and it is thus with him always!
Whoever goes short, it will not be Tom
Malone. Number one must have the best
of everything. Leaving him to enjoy his
dinner, we pass on to his son Denis, a
young man of four and twenty, who has
not thought it worth while to make any
change in his dress. Denis is undeniably
plain; even his fond mother—who shuts
her eyes to so many things—cannot close
them to this fact. He has dark, wiry,
unmanageable hair, deep-set grey eyes,
heavy eyebrows, heavy features, a hopeful
moustache, and huge ears that stand from
his head like the handles of a jug. When
we add that he has a large powerful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
frame, with hands and feet to correspond,
that he slouches as he walks, and wears
his hat on the back of his head, his portrait
is complete. Denis is clever and
has a fair share of brains; he is one of
those birds “who can sing, and won’t
sing.” Whilst others toil along the dreary
road of learning, he can skim the ground
with comparative ease. He has a taste
for mathematics, a taste for surgery, a
quick eye, a steady nerve, and a profound
faith in Denis Malone; but he has a still
greater taste for singing racy songs of his
own composition, for playing “spoil five”
and “poker,” and brewing whisky punch.
However, in spite of his innate idleness
and love of loafing and low company, his
poor infatuated mother believes that he
will be a credit to her yet. “Cuckoo,”
his sister, is but fourteen; therefore we
will hope that she may improve, and will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
not cruelly epitomise her features; suffice
to say that she is pale, long-legged, and
sandy, and characterised by extreme unreserve,
and insatiable curiosity.</p>

<p>Miss Malone is her mother’s right
hand, a first-rate household adjutant, but
her father and brother’s pest; she acts as
revising editor to all their best stories.
She knows when Denis is at Nolan’s (the
nearest public-house), instead of being, as
the Major imagines, in bed with toothache.
She knows <i>why</i> her mother hides the key
of the cellarette, and why her father never
opens, but angrily tears up, all communications
in certain blue envelopes. In
short, she is wise beyond her years.
Opposite to Cuckoo sits George, the new
arrival, in whose honour are the branch
candlesticks, topaz ornaments, and dessert.
He is a good-looking young man, with a
broad forehead, a pair of very expressive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
eyes, and a carefully cultivated dark
moustache, and, but that his aquiline nose
is too large for his face (or it may be
that his face is too thin for his nose) he
would be remarkably handsome; well-favoured,
well-dressed, and well-bred, he
makes an effective Valentine to his
brother’s Orson. In spite of his gallant
efforts, conversation languishes; queries
about hunting and shooting fall woefully
flat; his relatives evince but a tepid
interest in India, and his homeward
voyage; to tell the truth the Major’s
great mind is concentrated on his plate.
Mrs. Malone’s thoughts are distracted by
an alarming letter which she received
from the family grocer as she came
down to dinner, and Denis is wondering
how his brother makes his tie, and if he
will lend him twenty pounds. Cuckoo,
who has the unintelligible desire to talk,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
common to her sex and years, converses
affably for all, and keeps her unhappy
mother on thorns, lest she should disclose
too many domestic secrets. Having
disposed of her pudding with startling
rapidity, she said, as she scraped her
plate:</p>

<p>“Mother made this plum pudding herself;
she always makes the sweets now.
Last Christmas, Eliza, the cook, was
drunk; she sent the pudding up, stuck
all over with lighted matches; it looked
so funny; she drank the whisky! Once
she got at father’s whisky, that he keeps——”</p>

<p>“There, that will do, Cuckoo,” said the
Major, sharply. “Hold your tongue; I
wish there was a fly blister on it.”</p>

<p>By the time the decanters were placed
before him, the Major’s own tongue was
loosened, and he proceeded to discuss the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
neighbourhood with considerable animation.
<i>Apropos</i> of their own vicinity, he
said: “Nothing but parsons and old
women about here now, George! Great
changes, you will hardly know any one
in the parish. Eh! what? what?”</p>

<p>He usually concluded his sentence with
this query, repeated as sharply as a
postman’s knock.</p>

<p>“There are the Finnys and Miss Dopping,”
said Mrs. Malone, “and the
Wildes of Wildpark, and the Moores of
Roskeen. I don’t think you know Mrs.
Redmond. She came since you were
here last. She has a daughter——”</p>

<p>“I should rather think she <i>had</i> a
daughter,” interrupted the Major, rapturously.
“There is not a handsomer girl
between this and Dublin. Eh! what?
what?”</p>

<p>“Girl!” echoed his wife peevishly. “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
would scarcely call her a girl; she has
been in every garrison town in——”</p>

<p>“Come, come, that will do!” exclaimed
the Major rudely. “We all know you
don’t like her. What handsome woman
ever <i>is</i> appreciated by the old and ugly
of her own sex? I only wish I was a
young man for her sake,” and he gulped
down a bumper of family port.</p>

<p>“I’d be sorry to be hanging since she
was thirty,” muttered Denis, who generally
sided with his mother.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Redmond is dreadful,” said
Cuckoo, bravely, “she drawls out her
words as if they cost money, and she is
fearfully stingy and mean, she always
comes here at meal-time on purpose.”</p>

<p>“Yes, she is a fine old soldier, and
knows her way about,” admitted the
Major. “She never wants much for the
asking, from a plough to a pie dish, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
she has a voice that would crack an egg.
Eh! what?”</p>

<p>“She came here the other day,” continued
Cuckoo, volubly; “mother was
cooking, and could not see her, but she
and Belle marched in, all the same, and
said that they would wait for tea. We
happened to have nice hot soda cakes, and
Mrs. Redmond calmly took off her gloves
and poured out tea, and ate three buttered
cakes, and pressed them on Belle,
just as if she was in her <i>own</i> house,
and then said, ‘Cuckoo, as your mother
has a headache, she cannot eat soda
cakes; you have had as many as are
good for you, and it is a pity to let
them go downstairs, so I shall carry them
off.’ And she actually made me do them
up in paper, and took them home in her
muff. Did you ever know such a greedy
old thing?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span></p>

<p>“I never knew her match,” growled
Denis, in his deep voice. “The idea of
making that unfortunate girl drag her
about the country in a bath-chair the way
she does; she ought to be prosecuted for
cruelty to animals. Betty is worth a
thousand of Belle, with her airs and her
eyes, and her humbug. Betty has no nonsense
about her, and is as plucky as the
devil.”</p>

<p>“And who is Betty?” enquired George.</p>

<p>“You might remember her in old Redmond’s
time,” replied the Major. “A girl
in short frocks, spending her holidays at
Noone—a sort of poor relation. Her
mother died when she was an infant, and
her father was drowned, trying to save
another man’s life. She is now a tall slip
of a girl, that comes into a room like a
blast of wind, and runs mad over the
country, with her dogs and Cuckoo.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span></p>

<p>“She is a beautiful, warm-hearted,
young creature,” protested Mrs. Malone,
with a tinge of colour in her pale face.</p>

<p>“<i>Beautiful!</i> Oh, Lord,” shouted the
Major, derisively.</p>

<p>“And has two hundred a year of her
own,” continued his wife——</p>

<p>“Which Mrs. Redmond saves her the
trouble of spending,” supplemented Denis
in his deep voice, “and makes her go all
the messages, and weed the garden, and
draw the bath-chair. She is warranted
quiet in single harness, spirited but gentle—fine
action, mouth, and manners.”</p>

<p>“Betty does not mind,” proclaimed
Cuckoo; “she is never happy unless she
is busy. George, I am sure you will like
Betty.”</p>

<p>“At any rate, she is a pleasant contrast
to Belle, who spends half her time in
bed, reading novels. And has the devil’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
own temper,” remarked Denis in his basso
profundo.</p>

<p>“Hold your scurrilous tongue, sir,”
bawled the Major. “What the deuce do
<i>you</i> know about Miss Redmond?” Then
to George, “She has a fine high spirit,
which I must say I admire in a woman”—that
is, in a woman outside of his own
family—“she has been accustomed to the
best society all her life, and to a great
deal of attention, and dozens of admirers.
She is very gay and lively, and finds it
uncommonly slow at Noone. Poor girl,
she says every week seems a year. I tell
her if she wants to make the time fly,
she has only to draw a bill at three months.
Eh! what? what? She’s a deuced
pretty creature, and, begad, she and I are
uncommonly good friends.”</p>

<p>“She <i>flatters</i> father, that’s why he likes
her,” explained the fearless Cuckoo, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
her mother rose from table; and before
the Major had time to launch some furious
and fitting retort, Cuckoo was already
giggling in the hall.</p>

<p>Bridgetstown was a house with long
and windy passages, and Mrs. Malone and
her daughter hurried into the drawing-room,
whilst the men drew their chairs
up to the dining-room fire. The Major
lit a cigar, and began to talk “shop”
(as a compliment to his step-son), reviving
former memories of obsolete drill, and
ancient mess anecdotes. George, on his
part, assumed a polite interest in the recent
autumn meetings and the odds on the
Liverpool, and endeavoured to sympathise
with the Major’s bitter disappointment in
“the Blazeaway filly,” whom he had
backed heavily at Fairyhouse races.
Meanwhile Denis yawned, pulled Boozle’s
tail (thereby causing Boozle to lash it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
about furiously) and, when his father was
not looking, helped himself liberally to
port. After the Major had related his
favourite stock story, about a staff officer,
a river and a chest of drawers, George
and his brother joined their relatives in
the drawing-room, whilst the elder gentleman
adjourned to his own den, to his
pipe, his sporting papers, and his betting-book.
The drawing-room was cold and
cheerless, despite a fire and lamps. Mrs.
Malone rarely entered it, save to dust
the ornaments, and superintend Cuckoo’s
practising. In answer to her brother
George’s request, Cuckoo seated herself
before the grand piano with the utmost
self-possession, and proceeded to perform
a series of the most amazing exploits on
the key-board. She thumped the instrument
as though she had a spite against
it—which she had—and clawed it like a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
cat. Meanwhile her two brothers stood
near the fire and Mrs. Malone hemmed
handkerchiefs close to a reading lamp.
Once or twice she glanced furtively at
the pair on the rug. Could they both be
her sons? It seemed strange that that
tall young man with his air of distinction,
that courteous, scrupulously-dressed
stranger, could be brother to Denis, with
his round shoulders, wild hair, and rude
ways. Their voices were widely different.
Denis possessed a deep, uncultivated brogue
and inherited his father’s bullying delivery.
George spoke with a polished English
accent. Their manners also were in
strong contrast. George stood up when
she entered a room, placed a chair for
her, and listened to all she said with
deferential attention. Denis contradicted
her freely and frankly, and would as
soon have thought of standing on his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
head, as of offering her a seat. She was
his mother, and therefore of course devoted
to him. It was her business to mend
his clothes and his socks; fill his purse,
and hide his scrapes; all this was <i>her</i>
duty, and his——? Well, he offered her
his cheek to kiss every morning, when he
was at home, and wrote to her regularly—if
he wanted money—when he was
abroad. George resembled his father.
Poignant, melancholy memories stole into
her mind, as she watched him through
misty eyes—memories long banished by
heavy cares, and heavy bills, and selfish
domestic tyranny. What a different life
hers might have been, had George Holroyd
lived!</p>

<p>Cuckoo, who had now brought her
performance to a violent end, came over
to the fire, and stared expectantly at her
elder brother, with a half simpering, half<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
impudent expression. “Thank you,
Cuckoo,” he said with a dubious smile.</p>

<p>“Thank you for what?” she enquired
with a giggle.</p>

<p>“Well, since you ask me, for leaving
off.”</p>

<p>“I hate music!” thrusting her bony
shoulders out of her frock.</p>

<p>“So I should imagine! Mother, won’t
you sing something?”</p>

<p>At this suggestion Denis opened his
mouth in amazement, and then burst into
a loud and scornful guffaw.</p>

<p>“For goodness’ sake don’t ask the
mater to sing; you don’t know her voice
now; it’s like a cracked fog-horn.”</p>

<p>George turned sharply to his brother,
with an angry light in his eyes, but Mrs.
Malone interposed hastily:</p>

<p>“I never sing now; you forget that I
am quite an old woman, my dear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
George,” and she smiled up into his face
a pitiful smile.</p>

<p>But the little attention had pleased
her; she had been a renowned singer in
her day. What a pathetically sad little
sentence that is to many a woman—“In
her day.” How short is that day!
How fleeting—how soon forgotten by all
but herself!</p>

<p>“How nicely your clothes fit, George,”
remarked his sister. “What a swell you
are!” stroking his coat admiringly.</p>

<p>George made no reply: he could not
return the compliment. Cuckoo’s shabby
frock was nearly up to her knees, her
shoes were white at the toes, and her
pigtail was tied with a boot lace.</p>

<p>“We have never sat here since Aunt
Julia was over, last spring,” continued
Cuckoo, as she threw some turf on the
fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, has <i>she</i> paid a visit here? I did
not know.”</p>

<p>“I should rather think she <i>has</i> paid
a visit—a visitation,” rejoined Denis,
who was lolling with his hands in his
pocket and his eyes half shut—an
affectation of indolence being his best
substitute for easy self-possession. “We
thought we should have had to go away
ourselves to get rid of her. We were
afraid that she would be like the man
who came with his carpet bag to stay
from Saturday till Monday, and remained
for twenty years.”</p>

<p>“She would have gone if she <i>could</i>,”
retorted Cuckoo mysteriously; glancing
at her mother who was holding a parley
with some one at the door.</p>

<p>“What on earth do you mean? what
was to prevent her?” enquired Denis;
“the road was clear.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span></p>

<p>“I won’t tell you, for you hate Aunt
Julia, but I’ll tell George”—taking him
firmly by the button-hole, and speaking
in a whisper.</p>

<p>George rather mistrusted his gentle
sister’s artless confidences, but there was
no escape for him.</p>

<p>“She had no money for her journey;
twice she had it sent over, and twice
mother borrowed it, so she could not get
away; she was here three months.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, Cuckoo,” said her unwilling
listener, drawing back; “you should not
say such things.”</p>

<p>“What has she been telling you?”
asked Mrs. Malone, rather anxiously, as
she resumed her work.</p>

<p>“Only that we never sit here, mother,
or have a fire in this room, or dessert,
or coffee, or wine,” continued this
pleasant child. “It’s all on account<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
of <i>you</i>, George,” giving him a playful
poke.</p>

<p>She was excessively proud of her handsome
brother. Mrs. Malone reddened to
her liberal parting, and fidgeted uneasily
on her chair, and George said:</p>

<p>“Surely, mother, you are not going
to make a stranger of <i>me</i>?”</p>

<p>“The fatted calf for the prodigal son!
Eh! What? What?” said Denis,
mimicking his father, with a loud unmeaning
laugh.</p>

<p>“Prodigal son!” screamed Cuckoo.
“That’s yourself. Do you know the last
time he came home, George, he walked
the whole way from Dublin; he was
nearly barefoot, and he had pawned——”</p>

<p>“<i>Cuckoo!</i>” exclaimed her mother
authoritatively, “go and see if the passage
door is shut; now go at once.”</p>

<p>Cuckoo and Denis collided in the doorway,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
and left the room together; and
presently voices in angry recrimination,
and the sound of a hearty smack, and
loud sobs, were heard in the hall; then
a slamming of doors, a roar from the
Major’s study, and silence.</p>

<p>“Mother,” said George, after a truly
eloquent pause, “why don’t you send
Cuckoo to school? her accent is frightful,
and——”</p>

<p>“I know, I know,” interposed Mrs.
Malone, laying down her work, with a
dismal sigh. “I am afraid she must
strike you as ill-mannered and pert;
Julia thought so, too; but then she told
a whole room full of visitors that Julia
was coming as soon as she had put in
her new teeth; the child is a great help<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
to me in the house, and remarkably open
and truthful, as you may notice.”</p>

<p>“Yes, the very densest must admit
<i>that</i>, but the naked truths she introduces
so gleefully are not always pleasant
additions to a family circle.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not—perhaps she is too outspoken;
she ought to go to school. We
must think it over, but in these hard times,
George, I don’t know how we are to
afford the expense.”</p>

<p>“But I always understood that Major
Malone had his land in his own hands.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry to say he has, but farming
is not his forte. We are always
short of money. I cannot think how it
is!”</p>

<p>She knew but too well how it was.
The ready money received for oats, barley,
and young stock, went straight into the
Major’s yawning pockets, and then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
mysteriously evaporated! How could
she divulge to her son that his stepfather
had lost seven hundred pounds
at the Curragh, and nearly as much at
Cork Park races; that his wine merchant
and tailor were raving for their money;
that the servants were owed a year’s
wages; that she blushed to meet the
baker’s wife, and was afraid to enter the
post office.</p>

<p>“How is Denis getting on, mother?”
asked George, after a pause.</p>

<p>“I really do not know,” she replied
with evident reluctance. “Dr. Moran
thinks he has abilities; he is fond of
surgery, and you know, ever since he was
quite a boy, he has always killed our
pigs; he says himself that his next examination
is absurdly easy.”</p>

<p>“I am glad to hear it.”</p>

<p>“You see he has such high spirits,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
poor fellow,” continued his doting parent,
taking up arms for her darling, against
something intangible in his elder brother’s
voice. “He is so young and spirited.
It’s hard to be tied down to books and
loathsome disecting-rooms, when he is
such a splendid shot, and so fond of
hunting and fishing. He is very sorry
now that he ever decided to be a doctor;
he says he ought to have gone into the
army like you.”</p>

<p>“He can still be an army doctor.”</p>

<p>“So he can,” sighed Mrs. Malone, once
more resuming her needle. “Well, we
must think it over.”</p>

<p>George leant his elbow on the mantel-piece,
and looked at her attentively. How
different from the golden-haired angel of
his childhood! How aged and thin, and
worn she had become during these last
five years!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span></p>

<p>“Mother,” he said abruptly, “you are
looking ill and worried; what is the
matter? Have you any trouble on your
mind?”</p>

<p>“Yes, George, to tell the truth I have;
but I am not going to share it with you.
So don’t ask me. You have been only
too generous—the best of sons—and if I
have seen but little of you of late, nor
seemed a real mother to you, I have
never forgotten you day and night, and
when I heard that you were so ill, I
cannot tell you what I suffered, or describe
my feelings.”</p>

<p>(The Major’s feelings were those of
complacent anticipation; if George died
unmarried, his income of five hundred a
year lapsed to his mother for her life.)</p>

<p>“Are you quite sure that the sea
voyage has set you up? And <i>tell</i> me,
dear, do you wear flannel next to your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
skin?” gazing up into his face with an
expression of intense anxiety.</p>

<p>“Do I look like an invalid?” he returned
with an evasive smile. “I am as
right as a trivet now. I was well before
we reached Suez. Never mind me, but
tell me all about Denis,” and leaning
towards her, he said:</p>

<p>“Your trouble is about <i>him</i>, is it
not?”</p>

<p>“George, you must be a wizard. How
could you guess? Well, you are right;
it <i>is</i> about him. His college expenses
are frightful, and his tailor’s bill is
incredible.”</p>

<p>“I should not have supposed that he
spent much on his clothes,” remarked his
brother gravely.</p>

<p>“But he does, and there is a long
account at his grocer’s—he breakfasts in
his rooms—for tea and sugar, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
raisins, and candles—such <i>quantities</i> of
candles, but he will study at night.”
(Miserable Mrs. Malone! for candles, read
whisky, for sugar, porter, for tea, gin).
“I really dare not show them to his
father,” and she put a ragged lace handkerchief
to her eyes, and wept.</p>

<p>“Perhaps, mother, you had better
show them to <i>me</i>,” suggested George.</p>

<p>“No, no, you are far too liberal. You
have little enough as it is,” she sobbed.
“I am past help,” casting her thoughts
over all their debts, their accumulating
debts in Dublin, Ballingoole, and at the
county bank. “You might as well try
to bale the sea with a tea-spoon as to
help <i>me</i>.”</p>

<p>“But if I may not help my own
mother, whom may I help?” he urged
eagerly. “I have been living at a cheap
little up country station, where I had no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
way of spending rupees, and I have a
good balance at Cox’s. I can let you
have a cheque for three hundred pounds
at once.”</p>

<p>“Oh, George, I am ashamed to take
it,” she whimpered, drawing him towards
her, and throwing her arms round his
neck. “You make me feel like a guilty
woman; you make me feel like a thief.”</p>

<p>“Mother, you must never say that to
<i>me</i>. Besides, you forget that I brought
you home no presents. I was too hurried
to look for things in Bombay, and I am
sure you can lay out the money far
more sensibly than I should have done,
in trashy curiosities.”</p>

<p>(This three hundred pounds was part
of a sum that he had set aside for his
trip home; he had had visions of a
couple of clever hunters, of renting a
small shooting-box, of a round of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
London theatres, and a trip to Paris and
Nice.)</p>

<p>“Is it true that your Uncle Godfrey
is going to make you his heir?” she
asked, as she dried her eyes and
brightened up a little; “I heard something
about it from old Miss Holroyd.”</p>

<p>“No, he offered me a large allowance
if I would cut the Service and marry.”</p>

<p>“And what did you say, George? I
hope you promised to think it over.”</p>

<p>“I thanked him, and declined. I have
enough for myself. I have no idea of
marrying, and I mean to stick to the
Service, as long as it will stick to me.”</p>

<p>“If you ever <i>do</i> marry, dear, I hope
you will get a good wife. Marriage is
a great lottery, and there are many
blanks——”</p>

<p>One of these blanks now walked into
the room in the shape of Major Malone,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
followed by a tray of light refreshments,
also by Cuckoo, red-eyed, but tranquil.</p>

<p>George poured out a glass of wine,
and carried it to his mother, whilst
Cuckoo helped herself generously to
macaroons, remarking, as she did so:
“Denis says that sherry is <i>poison</i>—eighteen
shillings a dozen—don’t you
touch it; it’s only kept for visitors; we
never have supper like this when we
are alone. These are lovely macaroons,”
speaking with her mouth full. “Cleary,
the grocer, grumbled about giving them;
he is owed <i>such</i> a bill, and he says——”</p>

<p>“Cuckoo,” roared her father, turning
on her a countenance charged with fury,
“I have told you once before to-night
to hold your tongue. Upon my word,
Lucy, I believe that girl is possessed of
some devil. I shall pack her off to a
reformatory one of these days, I swear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
I shall. As to Cleary, the grocer,” now
blustering and helping himself to a stiff
tumbler of highly-coloured whisky and
water, “he is uncommonly proud of my
custom, and thankful to have it. It
was my father who first set him going,
and without the Malones of Bridgetstown
he would be in a very poor way.”
(Thanks to the Malones of Bridgetstown,
he <i>was</i> in a very poor way.)</p>

<p>The Major had a notion that tradespeople
actually considered his orders a
high compliment, and fully equivalent
to cash, and when he strutted into a
shop, be it tailor’s, saddler’s, or grocer’s,
he selected largely of the best. He did
not comprehend self-denial, nor why <i>he</i>
should lack anything that was furnished
to men of ten times his means. Yet
when creditors timidly ventured to ask
for their little account, he considered it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
a most impertinent liberty, as if they
were begging for <i>his</i> money. He was
not at all sensitive about debt; he owed
bills for years to his wine merchant and
tailor, and had not the most remote
intention of paying them. Ready cash
could be laid out so much more pleasantly
and satisfactorily. Besides, when
wine has been drunk, and coats worn
threadbare, is it not a cruel hardship to
have your immediate attention requested
to a very stiff account?</p>

<p>Cuckoo took shelter behind the chair
of her elder brother, and whispered to
him, as she munched her macaroons, that
“if anyone ought to be sent to a reformatory,
it was Denis; he was out
now, smoking in the harness room,
with Casey, the jockey, and Mooney, the
sweep.”</p>

<p>Soon after this refection the family<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
retired to rest. George had the luxury
of a fire in his room, and sat before it
for a long time, buried in thought.</p>

<p>What a home this was! His mother
a mere heart-broken household drudge;
his sister a mischievous, razor-tongued
little savage; his brother—he was beginning
to fear that Denis, of whom
his mother had written such glowing
accounts, was neither more nor less
than an idle scapegrace; and, as to
Major Malone—he was Major Malone.</p>

<p>Before the mistress of the house removed
her unwonted finery, she got an
envelope and pencil, and hurriedly jotted
down her most pressing debts. The
butcher’s bill was £209. Would £80
stop Mrs. Maccabe’s mouth? The baker
was owed £75, and one of Denis’ most
dangerous creditors was clamouring for
a hundred “on the nail.” There would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
be no margin for Cuckoo’s new outfit,
nor for the sealskin jacket for herself,
at which George had hinted. This three
hundred would be a mere drop in the
ocean. George must write her a larger
cheque. Yes! poor woman, her finer
feelings were blunted by distressing and
disgraceful shifts; the iron entered into
her soul when she evaded Miss Bolland,
and cringed to Mrs. Maccabe—terrible
Mrs. Maccabe! George was well off;
he had no ties, and but few expenses;
and, in spite of all her tears and deprecations,
she was prepared to despoil
her eldest born, to shield and succour
Denis.</p>

<p>“Lucy,” said the Major, looking
through his dressing-room door, tie in
hand, “do you think that fellow would
back a bill for me? Eh! what?
what?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>

<p>“No, indeed, Major, I am certain he
would not,” she returned indignantly.</p>

<p>“What have you got on that paper
there? Eh, show.”</p>

<p>“Bills; debts; we owe so much
money that I am ashamed to walk
through the town. Cleary, the grocer,
sent up to-day, and, as to Mrs. Maccabe,
I tremble when I see her.”</p>

<p>“Pooh! So does everyone; you are
not uncommon in that, the old termagant!
I say, is that son of yours
going to put his hand in his pocket?
What’s the use of a rich fellow like
that, if he won’t help his mother. Eh!
what? what?”</p>

<p>“He is not rich, far from it; he
believes that I have my jointure of four
hundred a year; he does not know that
I sold my life interest in it years ago.”</p>

<p>“I hope you impressed upon him that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
times were bad; I will go bail you
cried; it’s about the only thing you
are good at,” he concluded with a
savage sneer.</p>

<p>“He has promised me a cheque for
three hundred pounds,” said Mrs. Malone
coldly.</p>

<p>“By Jove! then I will go halves!”</p>

<p>“No, indeed, it’s little, it’s not half
enough. Do you know that we owe
Kane, the baker, seventy-five pounds,
and he is a poor man too.”</p>

<p>“Bosh! I’m a poor man; let these
cormorants wait. They <i>must</i>; debts of
honour come first, and I owe Dunne,
of Jockey Hall, a hundred pounds,
which will have to be paid at once.”</p>

<p>“A bet?”</p>

<p>“Yes, a bet,” he answered, with a
defiant scowl.</p>

<p>“Tom Malone,” she said, tearing the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
envelope slowly as she spoke, “do you
ever think what my life is? Do you
know how often I wish I were dead?
Do you suppose, if George Holroyd had
lived, that I would be the poor, mean,
unhappy wretch that I am?”</p>

<p>“There, don’t give me any more of
that sort of stuff; you know the old
proverb. Eh! what? Never marry a
widow, unless her first husband was
<i>hanged</i>. I have no doubt that if George
the First was the cool-headed, fastidious,
fine gentlemen his son is, he would
have been devilish sick of you long ago.
Mind one thing, I must have that hundred
pounds this week; that chap is
well off, times are hard. Why, I am
actually smoking a pipe, and drinking
cheap Scotch whisky! You are his
mother, you have a strong claim on
him. So don’t be afraid of opening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
your mouth.” And with this injunction,
he entered his dressing-room and shut
the door.</p>

<p>One scene more before the night closes.
Let us take a peep at Belle Redmond, as
she sits over her bedroom fire, with a
small looking-glass in her hand, carefully
examining first her teeth, then her eyelashes.
She has been building fine castles
in the air, ever since Juggy, at the lodge,
announced that “a strange gentleman, in
a grey ulster, had passed on a hack car,
about six o’clock.”</p>

<p>“He won’t come and call to-morrow,”
said Belle to herself. “No, but after to-morrow
we must always have a good
fire in the drawing-room, and I shall
wear my brown dress, and see that Eliza
is ready to answer the door. Betty must
make a cake. Oh, dear, I hope he will
be better than that oaf, Denis! And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
have some life and go in him, for I shall
do my best to marry him, no matter
how hideous he is. Another winter here
would finish me. I should certainly be
found hanging from the baluster one fine
morning. How Eliza would scream!
But she would not cut me down. No!
she hates me,” and she smiled at her reflection
in the mirror. “Yes,” she said,
with a nod to herself, “I am as handsome
and as irresistible as ever. And to
this young Holroyd, fresh from dowdy,
withered women in India, I shall seem
divine.”</p>

<p>Then she laid aside her mirror, and,
resting her chin on her hand, gazed into
the fire, with an expression of unusual
contentment in her dissatisfied dark eyes.
Here is an opportunity to sketch Belle’s
portrait, as she sits thus staring meditatively
into the red turf sods. She inherits<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
her dark eyes, her excitable
disposition, and her volcanic spirit, from
her grandmother, a French Canadian;
and ever since she was a pretty and
precocious—though somewhat sallow—infant,
she has absolutely ruled her
mother, who never attempted to contradict
her wishes, nor to restrain her
unusually fiery temper. What was
amusing petulance at three years of
age, was ungovernable passion at—well—twenty-nine.
For each disastrous love
affair, or social disappointment, had
served to increase the force of her most
prominent characteristic. She made no
effort to control her furies before inferiors,
or in the bosom of her family,
for she had an idea that, as she was
beautiful, she was absolved from being
good! Fortunately these domestic tornadoes
were of short duration, and, whilst<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
the storm raged (and Belle raved, and
stamped, and screamed) all the household
bent before it, as reeds in a strong
gale. When it passed over, the frantic
madwoman of ten minutes previously,
having gained her end, was a kissing,
weeping, coaxing slave. Mrs. Redmond
spoke of these visitations as “attacks on
the nerves,” but the servants gave them
a totally different interpretation. Belle’s
scenes were chiefly enacted for the benefit
of the home circle; but now and
then there had been disagreeable outbreaks
in shops, in boarding-houses, and,
above all, at the rehearsals of private
theatricals, after which, it had been the
painful office of her miserable mother to
offer abject apologies, to eat humble pie,
and to fly the neighbourhood. Belle was
undoubtedly out of her element at Noone,
a veritable swan upon a turnpike road.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
She danced admirably, sang delightful
little French songs, and acted with such
grace and <i>verve</i> and real dramatic feeling,
that spiteful people hinted that she was
a professional, whose temper had been
the bane of her engagements. But who
wanted piquant chansons, or inimitable
acting, in dreary Ballingoole? They
would have been respectively stigmatised
as French trash and tomfoolery; Belle
pined for her former nomadic existence,
and detested her present respectable anchorage.
She loved the town and the
gay haunts of fashion; loathed the
country, and had a true Frenchwoman’s
abhorrence of wet fields, muddy roads,
strong boots and draggled petticoats.
Although she only understood house-keeping
from a lady lodger’s point of
view, to wit, hashes, cold mutton, and
poached eggs, she nevertheless eagerly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
seized the reins of government on her
arrival at Noone. Her restless spirit and
maddening tongue (and, they said, mean
ways) soon drove the old servants wild—servants
accustomed to unlimited meat,
unlimited tea, and unlimited leisure.</p>

<p>There was one tremendous scene of
powerful domestic interest, and they all
gave warning, and departed “<i>en masse</i>.”
After this catastrophe, the keys were
made over to Betty, who established a
new régime—and a great calm. Belle was
unspeakably miserable; she had nothing
to do; no congenial society; nowhere to
display her gay new hats. Far be it
from <i>her</i>, to run after beagles, to gather
blackberries, or to visit stupid, narrow-minded
old ladies. She spent as much
time from home as possible, and, when
at Noone, lay novel-reading in bed, or
prowled restlessly from room to room,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
from window to window, and filled in the
weary hours by combing her poodle,
writing long letters, and reorganising her
wardrobe. Sometimes, in fine weather,
she dressed herself carefully, arrayed
“Mossoo” in a pink ribbon, and strolled
along a road that led to an—alas!—distant
garrison town, on the meagre chance
of meeting an officer who might drift
thus far to shoot or fish. If she encountered
one or two in a sporting dog-cart,
and if they had stared very hard at the
pretty, smartly dressed girl, and her well-trimmed
companion, Belle’s mission was
accomplished; she was happy for <i>that</i>
day.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The morning after George Holroyd’s
arrival, Mrs. Malone had a tearful and
pathetic conversation with her son; and,
as she sauntered, arm in arm with him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
round the wintry garden, she opened her
mouth to such an extent, that he was
compelled to make his head-quarters at
Bridgetstown. There would be no spare
cash for clever hunters, a trip abroad,
or even a little mixed shooting. Surely
Belle Redmond’s star was in the ascendant.</p>

<p>“Joey, Joey, Foxy Joe, I say, hold hard.”</p>

<p>Thus challenged by Denis Malone, in
a ringing brogue, an elderly dwarf,
who had been shuffling along a boreen,
halted and looked sharply about him.
It was at the close of a dull afternoon;
there was more than a hint of frost in
the air, and over the marshy lands, at
either side of the lane, a thin white mist
was rising. To the left, Denis and his
step-brother, with guns on their shoulders,
were struggling across a bit of bog—towards
where Joey stood awaiting them.
Joey is possibly fifty years of age, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
not more than four feet in height. He
has a long body, and very short legs;
nevertheless, he wears the clothes of a
full-grown man; his frieze coat almost
sweeps the ground; his waistcoat reaches
half way to his boots, and his trousers
are doubled back to his knees, and there
pinned; long, reddish elf locks fall over
his collar, and his little grey eyes look
out somewhat vacantly from a pent-house
of bushy red brows. However, if not
very bright—although Joey’s enemies declare
that he is more of a knave than a
fool—at any rate he has wit enough for
his business; he is messenger and postman
to the neighbourhood, and wears a
leather bag, slung over his shoulder, as
an insignia of his profession. In one
hand he carries a stout blackthorn, and
in the other a plump woodcock. A
minute later, George Holroyd was within<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
easy hail, coming over the wet tussocks
with long strides; these long strides
suddenly increased to a rapid run, for a
deep, wet gripe, with treacherous sides of
thick, withered grass, lay between him
and Joey. “You’ll never do it, Captain
darlin’,” screamed the dwarf, raising his
stick. “It’s eighteen foot if it’s——”
Before another word left his lips, “Captain
darlin’” stood in the boreen beside
him.</p>

<p>“Oh, begorra thin, well lepped!
You’re as souple as Pat Kearney’s heifer;
he can’t keep her out of the potato garden,
at no price. Is she loaded, Captain?”
pointing to the gun. (N.B., the
Irish peasant believes every young officer
to be a captain at the very least.)</p>

<p>“To be sure, she is.”</p>

<p>“An’ supposin’ she went off and shot
me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span></p>

<p>“No fear of that, Joey,” remarked
Denis, who had joined them. “A mannikin
like you would be as hard to hit as
a jack snipe, and they are the very devil.
We saw nothing else to-day.”</p>

<p>“Well, well; so ye had poor sport,
had ye? It’s a bad day for fowling;
what ails the red terrier, Crab?”</p>

<p>“I peppered him with No. 9 shot, and
I want you to carry him home.”</p>

<p>“Is it Crab?” he returned, in a tone
of peevish incredulity. “Faix, Mr. Denis,
a lighter job would answer me better!
I’m sorry you did not shoot him all out,
when ye went about it! I’ve a print of
his teeth in the calf of me leg yet.
Look at him now, rowling the white of
his eye on me, bad cess to him.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, carry my gun; that won’t
bite you.”</p>

<p>“Be gor! I would not touch a shootin’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
iron for the Pope himself—may be she’d
go off in spite of me.”</p>

<p>“What good are you, then?” exclaimed
Denis, angrily. “Afraid of a
dog; afraid of a gun; I’ll go bail you
would not be so nervous if you were
asked to carry a quart bottle of whisky.”</p>

<p>“Begorra, yer honour, ye have only to
<i>thry</i> me! I’ve just been over at Mr.
Blake’s. Now there’s a man for ye!
He called me in, and gave me a glass
of spirits strong enough to take the paint
off a hall door. Be gor,” his little eyes
glistening at the recollection, “to this
minute itself, I’m aware of a torch-light
procession going down me throat.”</p>

<p>“And what have you got there?”
continued Denis imperiously.</p>

<p>“Oh, a terrible fine young woodcock
Mr. Blake is sending Mrs. Redmond.”</p>

<p>“Show it here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span></p>

<p>Joey tendered it proudly.</p>

<p>“It’s a fine, heavy bird,” said Denis,
balancing it critically on the palm of his
hand. “And it’s a mortal sin to give it
to an old woman that does not know
goose from grouse. Where was it
shot?”</p>

<p>“By Bresna Wood, I’m thinking—they
are in now, but it’s over early to be
shooting them yet.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Denis, with the skill of a
conjurer, had thrust his hand into his
lean game-bag, and dexterously substituted
the noble woodcock for a miserable
jack snipe, which, as all the world knows,
strongly resembles the former in everything
but size. “Well, Joey, here you
are!” handing him the snipe with imperturbable
countenance.</p>

<p>“What!” screamed Joey, surveying
it with open-mouthed horror. “What<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
devil’s trick are you up to now, Mr.
Denis? Arrah!” snatching at it passionately.
“Give it back to me here,
before you make a <i>wran</i> of it.” It was
evident that Joey believed that Denis
had wrought a spell on the bird, and
might possibly develop it so far as to
reduce the woodcock to nothing at all.</p>

<p>“What’s come over it?” he whimpered,
turning it about in great perplexity.
“What have ye done to it, at
all, at all? Ye ought to be ashamed of
yourself, so ye ought; it’s not the
weight of a robin red-breast.”</p>

<p>“Then give it to me again, and I’ll
blow on it, and make it the size of a
cock turkey.”</p>

<p>“In troth, and I won’t. I know yer
<i>too</i> well. Here our roads part,” opening
a gate that led towards Noone, “and I’ll
be for wishing ye good evening, gentlemen;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
<i>gentleman</i>, I mane,” he muttered
to himself as he shambled off, with the
jack in his hand. “Sure all the world
knows there’s only <i>wan</i> in it.”</p>

<p>Denis put down Crab; leant his gun
against the gate, and gave vent to a loud
ironical view halloo. “Gone away—gone
away—gone away!”</p>

<p>An unpleasant reference to Joey’s nickname
which Joey deeply resented. He
turned back for a moment and shook his
stick furiously at Denis, saying: “Never
fear, me fine fellow, but I’ll have it in
for ye <i>yet</i>,” and then plodded on.</p>

<p>“How that chap does hate me!”
remarked Denis complacently, as he
shouldered his gun. “I’d like to wring
his neck. He is the spy and informer of
the whole country.”</p>

<p>“I say, though! that’s rather hard lines
about the bird,” expostulated his brother,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
who had lagged behind, to pick up Crab.
“What will Mrs. Redmond think, when
she receives a surprisingly minute jack
snipe, with Mr. Blake’s compliments?”</p>

<p>“Oh! I’ll take down the woodcock
myself this evening, and kill two birds
with one stone, for I shall see Betty—not
to speak of Belle, a belle that no one
seems disposed to ring, in spite of her
fine eyes, smart frocks, and fascinating
manners.”</p>

<p>“Talking of manners,” said his brother,
“I wish Cuckoo could be sent to school.”</p>

<p>“You may well say so! she’s an awful
brat. The mother spoils her and gives
her her head entirely.”</p>

<p>“She ought to be sent to some good,
strict establishment without delay.”</p>

<p>“She ought,” assented Denis; “many
things <i>ought</i> to be done, if the coin were
forthcoming. For instance, I ought to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
have been put into the Service—a cavalry
regiment for choice—an only son and
heir to a property, instead of being a
pill!”</p>

<p>“How soon will you take your degree?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I hate the whole
thing; sometimes I think I’ll enlist.”</p>

<p>“If I were you, I would stick to my
profession, it’s a very good one, and now
you are four and twenty, Denis, it’s time
you began to put your hand to the
plough.”</p>

<p>“I suppose the mater has been asking
you to lecture me, eh?” said Denis in a
surly voice.</p>

<p>“No, indeed, she has not. She has the
greatest faith in you, Denis. I am only
speaking off my own bat.”</p>

<p>“Then, in that case, please keep your
bat out of my affairs. I don’t meddle
with you, do I?” he enquired savagely.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
“You have never done anything for <i>me</i>
that I know of, and have no right to
offer your opinion and advice. Advice is
cheap.”</p>

<p>“All the same, I intend to tell you
that I am very sorry to see you idling
about at home, instead of making a start,
and Cuckoo growing up without any
education at all,” returned his brother
firmly.</p>

<p>“Oh, she is not as bad as you think,”
said Denis in a milder key. It would not
suit him to have a row with George.
“She does lessons three times a week
with Betty Redmond; she and Betty are
tremendous pals—and talk of an angel,
here she comes!”</p>

<p>At this moment, a roomy bath-chair,
containing a substantial old lady, appeared
looming down the road. At first it seemed
to be rolling along of its own accord,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
but, on nearer inspection, a black hat was
visible (though almost concealed by Mrs.
Redmond’s bonnet, and enormous yellow
boa). A slender young girl was the
motive power, and pushing behind with
might and main.</p>

<p>It was getting dark, and faces were not
seen very distinctly, but when Mrs. Redmond
came near the two sportsmen,
she imperatively called out, “Stop,” and
waved Denis towards her, with her
gigantic fur muff.</p>

<p>“I’ve just been up to Bridgetstown,
but I did not see your mother. They
<i>said</i> she was out; however, I went in
and sat down, to give Betty a rest.
Cuckoo entertained us about—Ah, I suppose
<i>this</i> is your brother; it is so dark,
Mr. Holroyd, that I am sorry I cannot
see you; but I am delighted to make
your acquaintance.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Holroyd muttered indistinctly, and
removed his cap.</p>

<p>“I am afraid you will find it frightfully
dull here, and <i>so</i> different to military
life! I am devoted to the army, so is my
daughter Belle. We have many friends
in the Service. I hope we shall see a
great deal of you; whenever you are feeling
at all bored, mind you come and
look us up!”</p>

<p>Mr. Holroyd declared that he would
be charmed to accept Mrs. Redmond’s
invitation, but that he was sure he
would not be at all bored; he liked
the country, and hoped to have some
hunting.</p>

<p>Hitherto no one had noticed the girl
behind the chair. The outline of her
features was indistinguishable; nevertheless,
George had compassion on her, and
said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span></p>

<p>“Is this not rather heavy work; the
roads are so muddy?”</p>

<p>“Not at all! Not at all!” rejoined
Mrs. Redmond hastily. “It’s all downhill
going home, and exercise is capital
for young people, especially this kind of
exercise, for it brings all the muscles into
play, legs and arms alike.”</p>

<p>“But surely it is rather a long distance
for one young lady,” expostulated George.</p>

<p>“You ought to have Miss Redmond
posted somewhere on the road as second
horse—lay a dâk, as they call it in India,”
suggested Denis facetiously.</p>

<p>“Pooh! it’s only a mile from gate to
gate. Belle would be only too delighted
to take her turn, but she is such a little
delicate darling, the slightest physical
exertion knocks her up at once. For a
strong girl it is nothing. Why, at Folkestone,
I used to keep a bath-chair man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
for three hours at a stretch, and Betty
has had a long rest.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, I hope you will accept
me as her substitute, and permit me to
convey you home,” said George politely.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, really, Mr. Holroyd,” exclaimed
the old lady (divided between
delight at the offer, and apprehension as
to the style of raiment in which her dear
Belle might be discovered), “I would
not think of it; no, not on any account.”</p>

<p>“Oh! but you must. I assure you I
will take no refusal, I never take a
refusal” (this was an excellent trait,
thought the old lady), as he placed his
hand on the back of the chair.</p>

<p>“Here, Denis, you can carry my gun,
and Crab will have to walk; he is more
frightened than hurt;” and before Mrs.
Redmond could expostulate, he was rolling
her rapidly homewards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span></p>

<p>“Well this <i>is</i> kind,” she said. “What
a delightful change from Betty; she does
jerk so, and can scarcely get me on at
all. I’m sure it is all knack.”</p>

<p>“Knack, indeed,” thought her charioteer.
“By Jove! this old woman weighs fifteen
stone, and the chair as much as a cab;
unfortunate girl, how her arms must
ache!”</p>

<p>Meanwhile the unfortunate girl, and
Denis, lingered behind, and Denis made
over the woodcock, with a short sketch of
its history, and roars of laughter.</p>

<p>“And how do you like <i>him</i>?” enquired
Betty, looking after the bath-chair. “Is
he the stuck-up beast you expected?”</p>

<p>“No, I cannot say that he is stuck-up,
but he is rather superfine for Bridgetstown;
he wears silk socks of an evening,
flies to open the door for the mater, and
calls the governor ‘Sir.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span></p>

<p>“You must be quite startled at such
queer ways,” returned the girl, with an
irony that was completely lost on her
listener. “Anything else?” she asked
blandly.</p>

<p>“He is shocked at Cuckoo, and no
wonder, and he has been trying to lecture
<i>me</i>.”</p>

<p>“And no wonder,” she echoed expressively.</p>

<p>“Now, Betty!”</p>

<p>“Pray, what was the text of his
lecture?”</p>

<p>“Hanging about at home, and you
know <i>who</i> is to blame for that,” and he
tried to look sentimental, as he peered
into her face.</p>

<p>“Denis, don’t be ridiculous! you are
like a dying duck in a thunderstorm.
I know very well who is to blame for
your idleness; no less a person than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
yourself: you loaf about the country
with a gun or a rod, when you ought
to be earning your living, or learning
to earn your living, like another young
man. I wonder you are not ashamed of
yourself, I know <i>I</i> am ashamed for you.”</p>

<p>“I’ve a good mind to enlist!” he
exclaimed in a tone of gloomy resolution.</p>

<p>“Well, anything is better than idleness,”
returned Betty cheerfully. “I
would far rather see you a steady private
soldier, than a good-for-nothing private
gentleman.”</p>

<p>“There’s no one, not even my mother,
who would dare to speak to me as you
do, Betty Redmond.”</p>

<p>“Your mother, poor soul! I suppose
not, but as to other people, it’s not
that they don’t dare—they don’t <i>care</i>!
Do you imagine that anyone is afraid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
of such an insignificant helpless idler as
Denis Malone?”</p>

<p>“Betty, you <i>have</i> a tongue, and no
one suspects it but me!” cried Denis,
angrily.</p>

<p>“Well, I am very glad that it is
sharp enough to penetrate your rhinoceros
skin. I hope you will take what it says
to heart. Now, I must fly. They are
nearly out of sight.” And with a
gesture of farewell, she ran after the
bath-chair.</p>

<p>Mrs. Redmond talked incessantly as
she was trundled along. She discoursed
of the dreariness of the country, of her
military friends, of her limited means,
and of Belle, her beautiful Belle!
Utterly lost in this wilderness—a veritable
pearl among swine—Belle, the ornament
of countless balls, the admired of
all, the cynosure of even royal eyes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
and yet, in spite of her dull life at
Noone, she was so gay, so contented,
the very light of the house!</p>

<p>This was satisfactory information, for
when they arrived at the hall door, the
whole mansion was in outer darkness.
Belle was sitting in the study, with a
small French poodle in her lap, and
three fox terriers stretched out before
the fire, in various attitudes of luxurious
repose. These latter animals had been
the property of the late master of
Noone, and actually enjoyed a legacy of
five pounds each per annum, for the
term of their natural lives—and of
course it was Mrs. Redmond’s interest
to prolong their days, though she did
not care for dogs. Their names were
respectively “Brown,” “Jones,” and
“Robinson,” and they had each their
distinctive characteristics.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span></p>

<p>“Brown” was stout, elderly, and self-conscious;
he liked his comforts, such
as fire, a regular walk, and a good and
punctual dinner. He was a <i>bon vivant</i>
and did not eat fat or vegetables—an
habitué of the kitchen—and slept with
the cook.</p>

<p>“Robinson” was a young and very
handsome animal, who was fond of
admiration, and ladies and tea; was
particular about his appearance, and had
quite a fund of small affectations; he
was a general favourite—even Mrs.
Redmond was proud of “Robinson.”</p>

<p>“Jones” was also young and handsome—white
body, black and tan head—a
mighty hunter, whose thoughts were
centred on sport, and who cared not
a straw for the cook—indeed his whole
heart was given to Betty. He led a
joyous, but by no means innocent, life,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
in the woods, and would sit over a
rabbit hole for hours, and, when he
was in full chase of poor bunny, his
delighted barks made the plantations to
ring. Many a time, he would return
late at night, and lay his prey at
Betty’s feet, gobble down his dinner,
stretch his tired, muddy body before
the fire, and there hunt in dreams!</p>

<p>On this particular evening, all the
dogs were at home, “laid out,” so to
speak, on the hearth-rug, whilst Belle
nursed “Mossoo” and devoured a battered
novel, by the light of a cheap candle.</p>

<p>“Mossoo,” a pampered, shivering, discontented
little beast, was adored by
his mistress—in fact, she belonged to
him—not he to her! He was washed,
trimmed, be-ribboned and caressed, fed
on cream and chicken, and dainty dinners,
with plenty of gravy. He had no sporting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
instincts, he disliked mice, was desperately
afraid of cats and of wetting his
feet, and the other dogs hated him, as
boys in a family invariably hate the pet,
the coward, and the sneak. He was
accomplished too, degradingly accomplished;
and as he went through his
antics and stood upon his head, “Brown,”
“Jones,” and “Robinson” sat and stared
at him with grave and scornful faces,
and seemed to glance at one another as
much to say: “Did you <i>ever</i> see such a
fool?”</p>

<p>However, as long as “Mossoo” had
fresh cream and a soft pillow, and his
mistress’s applause and devotion, he was
above the opinion of his fellows.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was an unusual sound,
a strange voice in the hall; the dogs
leapt to their feet, and tore out of the
room, one yelping, skelping whirlwind.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
If Belle had been a man, she would
have used strong language as she capsized
“Mossoo,” laid down her book, and
strained her ears to catch a sound above
that maddening din.</p>

<p>Yes! a man’s voice, and then her
mother’s.</p>

<p>“Oh, you must come in, you really
must! and have a glass of our celebrated
rhubarb wine” (celebrated indeed!)</p>

<p>Belle jumped up. She was in a
shabby, old, red tea-gown; her hair
resembled a bottle brush. With great
presence of mind she blew out the
candle, pushed one or two chairs into
their places, flung herself into a luxuriant
seat, rather out of the fire-light, and
feigned sleep.</p>

<p>“If mother orders the lamp,” she
said to herself, “I am lost.”</p>

<p>But luckily her astute old mother<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
grasped the situation, and when, ten
minutes later, George Holroyd took
leave, he carried away with him the
memories of a dim room, a pair of
magnificent dark eyes, a ditto of restless,
small, white hands, and a bewitching
smile. It is not certain, that he
had not left a minute portion of his
heart behind him. At any rate he
had promised to return the following
day, and bring his music, all his songs,
and more especially his <i>duets</i>. His late
arrival at home was the subject of
much graceful badinage on the part of
his brother and sister.</p>

<p>“Did you see Belle, and was she
dressed?” enquired the latter, capering
round him.</p>

<p>“Of course she was dressed, you
little savage.”</p>

<p>“I am surprised to hear it. How I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
wish you had caught her in her old
red dressing-gown.”</p>

<p>“Was the chair heavy?” enquired
Denis.</p>

<p>“Weighs a ton; the old lady should
really charter a pony or a donkey.”</p>

<p>“She had a fine donkey to-day and
that was yourself,” returned Denis with
a grin. “Fancy tooling old Mother
Redmond home! Upon my word, I did
not think you were so soft. Eh! what?”</p>

<p>Her eldest son’s generous cheque had
lifted a heavy load of care from Mrs.
Malone’s bowed shoulders. She had
caulked and repaired her sinking credit,
with various gratifying sums “on
account,” and although the Major bullied
her out of one hundred pounds, and
Denis blarneyed away twenty more, yet
she contrived to pay the most pressing
village bills and the servants’ wages,
and to purchase some much-needed
garments for Cuckoo and herself. In a
new bonnet and gown, she was a comparatively
happy woman, when she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
carried her soldier son round to call on
the neighbourhood—on the Mahons of
the Glen, the Lynches of Newton-Girly,
the Moores of Roskeen, Miss Dopping
and the Finnys. Mrs. Finny—who was
as much too sweet as her daughter was
the reverse—clasped her bony hands,
ecstatically, in Mrs. Malone’s face, as she
welcomed her, and brought a tinge of
red into George Holroyd’s tanned cheek,
by saying: “So <i>good</i> of you, my dear,
kind friend, to bring your handsome son
to see us.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Malone’s handsome son needed
no introduction to Noone, and was perfectly
competent to find his way there
alone! He had received several cups of
tea from the fair hands of Belle—little
did he suspect the claws that were at
the end of those soft, white fingers—how
should he? Belle was on her best, her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
very best behaviour—and he had lunched
there once, in company with Denis, on
rabbit pie, bottled gooseberries, and rhubarb
wine—yet lived to tell the tale!
but on no occasion had he come across
the girl who had wheeled the bath-chair.
Nor, to be perfectly frank, did he miss
her.</p>

<p>After a long morning’s tramp over
bogs and marshes, the dark November
afternoons were somewhat difficult to
dispose of (a late dinner has its draw-backs),
and it was not altogether unpleasant
to stroll across to Noone, and sit
over its drawing-room fire, with a brilliant
companion, who always remembered that
he took no sugar, and very little cream;
sang tender love songs, and sparkling
French chansons, with considerable expression;
told amusing anecdotes with
much vivacity and gesticulation, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
enrolled him in a kind of delightful,
confidential, companionship.</p>

<p>They knew so many mutual military
acquaintances, and military stations, and
both were aliens to this monotonous rural
existence. Belle was vivacious in appreciative
company, related malicious
tales of her neighbours, flattered him
discreetly about his singing and shooting,
and told him, with a sigh, that he reminded
her so forcibly of a very great
friend of hers, who, she subsequently let
fall, was as handsome as a god!—and
yet people said that Belle was not clever
and that Betty had ten times her brains.
Whilst this merry young couple laughed
and talked and sang, Mrs. Redmond
dozed over her knitting, or woke up
with a start, to gaze at the animated
faces at the tea table, and to watch
George Holroyd furtively, with a cunning,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
predatory glance out of her little
yellowish eyes. Would anything come
of <i>this</i>? she wondered. She was desperately
anxious about her daughter’s
future. At her death Noone reverted to
another branch of the family, and her
beautiful, helpless, hot-tempered Belle
would be left to face the world with a
very scanty income. Her own life, she
knew, could not be prolonged. She was
in the deadly grip of a fatal malady,
and if she could only see Belle well
married, she would die happy and with her
mind at rest, but Belle was “getting
on,” and was, alas! still Miss Redmond.
And she bent all her energies to screwing
and scraping every spare halfpenny,
in order to leave her daughter a better
provision when she herself had passed
away. Now and then, she had reluctantly
fitted her out for a short<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
campaign in England, for a tour of
what proved to be barren visits, remaining
herself at Noone, to count the
potatoes and sods of turf, and to subsist
on rabbits and herrings. The mere act
of putting by one sovereign after another,
soon became her keenest pleasure, and
the enjoyment grew stronger the more
it was indulged in, though she always
assured herself that this feverish gathering
in of shillings and pound notes had
nothing to do with a love of money, but
solely with her love of Belle! Belle herself
had no anxieties about her future.
She had made up her mind to marry
George Holroyd and accompany him to
India—her promised land. She was a
young woman of some decision where her
own interests were concerned, and possessed
a considerable fund of tenacity—in
spite of which several of her admirers had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
detached themselves, and escaped;—and,
although she was by no means in love
with her new acquaintance, she was
enamoured of his profession and his
prospects, and her restless spirit yearned
for the perpetual changes of scene insured
to an officer’s wife. Visions of
gay cantonments, and still gayer hill
stations, rose before her mental eye—visions
in which she saw herself living
in a whirl of balls, theatricals, and
picnics, the queen of society, the best-looking,
best dressed, and most admired
of her sex; with legions of generals,
aide-de-camps, yea, and commissioners,
figuratively, at her feet. With each
visit George paid, these dreams assumed
more real and brilliant hues. Woe, woe,
be to the hand that would dispel them,
and condemn her to damp dreary Noone,
and the society of the Finnys, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
Malones, for life—a life that to Belle,
with her intense vitality, and quenchless
craving for excitement, would be
simply a living death!</p>

<p>George Holroyd was really quite
amazed to find what rapid strides he had
made in intimacy with the Redmonds.
We know how easily the great leviathan
may be led, when once a hook is in his
nose! and how simple it is for any
idle young man to become entangled in
the web of a pretty and experienced flirt.
He began to feel almost apologetic and
uncomfortable, when his mother regularly
enquired at dinner “where he
had been?”</p>

<p>And he replied as punctually: “Over
to Noone,” or, “I just looked in at
Noone,” “I had tea at Noone.”</p>

<p>Cuckoo’s ill-bred titter, and Denis’s
wink, were not lost upon him, much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
less the Major’s ponderous chaff, and
constant regret that “he was not a
young man, for Belle Redmond’s sake.”
Belle was a pleasant companion for an
hour or so, but George was not thinking
of her as a companion for life.</p>

<p>He had discovered that she was a
young lady that one came to the end of
very soon. She was smart, sparkling
and pretty; her animated gestures, and
the playful little stamp of her foot, were
all very taking in their way; but she
was shallow, restless, and spiteful, and
had a singularly foolish laugh. True that
to him she was undeniably sweet—sweet
as Turkish delight—but then, with most
people, a little of that cloying dainty
goes a long way.</p>

<p>In his guilty heart, this miserable
young man knew that he was daily expected
to tea at Noone; that he already<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
had his own particular chair, and tea
cup, and that he had given Belle a
quantity of new songs, a belt of his
regimental colours, and his photograph
in two positions; but surely, he would
argue with himself, she was a sensible
girl, and too well accustomed to society
and the ways of the world, to suppose
that these were more than the most
ordinary attentions, and, then, Mrs. Redmond
had been very civil to <i>him</i>, and
given him “carte blanche” to come and
shoot rabbits whenever he pleased. Crafty
old person! She sold the rabbits in the
town for sevenpence apiece, or hung
them in the larder, and saved her
butcher’s bill.</p>

<p>To tell the truth, she and Mrs. Maccabe,
the butcher’s relict and successor in the
business, were not on very friendly terms.
If the Malones’ bills were alarmingly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
long, Mrs. Redmond’s were pitifully
small.</p>

<p>“A pound and a half of neck chops, is
it, ma’am?” Mrs. Maccabe would scream.
“No, ma’am, <i>not</i> to-day; you’ve had
chops for the last three months. I suppose
ye think the shape is made of chops,
but let me inform you, ma’am, that you
are under a mistake. Shape has legs and
loins, and fore-quarters; you can take
one of them, or go without.”</p>

<p>And then Mrs. Maccabe, a powerful,
formidable matron, in a large black bonnet,
would seize an ox tail, kept for the
purpose, and lay about her vigorously
among the listening, sniggering street
urchins, whilst Mrs. Redmond would stalk
back majestically to her bath-chair—and
subsequently send a pencilled order for
a sheep’s head. Mrs. Maccabe was an
authority in the town; even her grown-up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
married sons quailed before her tongue
and her ox tail, and Maria Finny (herself
a fearless speaker) stood in respectful
awe of the butcher’s widow.</p>

<p>“One day,” to quote that championess,
who related the story with virtuous complacency,
“she made a holy show of Miss
Finny before the whole street.” Maria,
on frugal thoughts intent, had stepped in
to remonstrate about a bit of gristle which
she produced carefully wrapped in paper.
“Av course, I know that to please <i>some</i>
people bastes must be made without skin,
and sinews and bone. Weigh it, Sam!”
shouted Mrs. Maccabe to her son. “<i>One</i>
ounce. Cut Miss Maria an ounce of
mate!”</p>

<p>“There, miss,” solemnly presenting it
in paper, “I daresay it will serve you
for a dinner.”</p>

<p>Maria flung the packet into the middle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
of the street, and followed it in a fury,
whilst her opponent placed her hands
upon her fat sides and shook with wheezy
laughter.</p>

<p>The widow had her good points, of
course, or she would have had but few
customers, on whom to sharpen her terrible
tongue. Indeed her poorer patrons
did not care a straw for her abuse, and
paid her honestly in her own coin, with
ruthless and ready answers. She was
most charitable in secret, and many a
fine chop and steak, and many a strong
bowl of broth, was given away <i>quite</i> on
the sly. She was long-suffering to those
who were really badly off, a devout Catholic,
and a liberal contributor to her own
Church: besides this, her meat was prime—unsurpassed
in the whole province—and
no better judge of a beast ever stood in
a fair than Bridget Maccabe. As the poor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
innocent animals passed unconsciously
before her, she could tell to a pound
how they would cut up! Her purchases
were young, healthy, and well-fed; she
scorned to deal in tough old, milch
cows, and skinny strippers, and boasted
that no second-class joint ever hung
beneath the sign of “B. Maccabe and
Sons.”</p>

<p>During the days in which George Holroyd
had developed so brisk an acquaintance
with Noone, he had never once
come across Betty Redmond. She was
not kept out of his way in the upper
or lower regions (as might be suspected),
in case her claims to attention should
clash with those of her cousin. Oh dear,
no! Belle had no sincerer admirer. Betty
was her willing drudge: she sewed for
her, brought her breakfast in bed, and
ran her errands with alacrity, Belle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
accepting these services with smiling
thanks, and honeyed speeches. Her cheap
fascinations secured for her a devoted
attendant, and saved her a lady’s-maid.</p>

<p>Betty, who had known Ballingoole, and
everyone in the neighbourhood, all her
life, was quite at home in comparison
with Mrs. Redmond and her daughter.
She spent her holidays there, and looked
forward to her visits to Noone, as if she
were going direct to an earthly paradise.
She loved the country, whether in summer
or winter. She loved old “Playboy,”
the bay hunter who had taught her to
ride, and now lay buried at the end of
the orchard. She was fond of the dogs,
the cart horses, the very cows.</p>

<p>She was also fond, in a way, of old
Uncle Brian, with his goggle eyes, red
face, and loud voice, but here her love
was somewhat tempered by fear. He set<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
her on horseback when she was seven
years old, and flogged old “Playboy,”
over big fences, in order to teach her to
ride like an Irishwoman, and he laughed
till the tears ran down his cheeks, when
the chestnut filly kicked her off in the
lawn, and went away with the best half
of her habit. He took her out with him
when he went snipe shooting, to make
her active and hardy; nor dare she flinch,
before the deepest, blackest bog-drain, and
he taught her to play backgammon and
cribbage, and swore at her roundly if
she made a mistake. “To be afraid of
nothing, to speak the truth, and to pull
up her stockings,” were the injunctions
which he enforced on his grand-niece.
He left other matters to her instructors
at the English school.</p>

<p>When Betty was sixteen, her Uncle
Brian died quite suddenly of apoplexy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
said to have been induced by a fit of
furious passion, and when she returned to
Noone, her heart sank within her, for
a new mistress was coming, and she
expected great changes. The new mistress
was an Englishwoman, with a pretty
daughter, and both were total strangers
to Ballingoole and Betty.</p>

<p>Betty went mournfully round the place
in her new black dress, accompanied by
her intimate friends, “Brown,” “Jones,”
and “Robinson.” There had been an
auction of all the stock and out-door
effects; the yard was full of straw, and
bits of boxes and newspapers; the stables,
byre, and coach house were empty; the
house itself, how dreary and forlorn; at
every turn she missed old Uncle Brian,
with his loud voice and tapping stick,
and was very miserable indeed, till Miss
Dopping came that afternoon, and carried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
her away to her own home, and subsequently
to visit the Moores of Roskeen.</p>

<p>A week or two later, Mrs. Redmond
arrived, inquisitive, astute, agreeable—prepared
to tolerate Betty, and to tolerate
the dogs—and to make a little money
out of both!</p>

<p>But Betty was a delightful surprise;
a bright, clever, active girl, full of good
humour and energy, who knew the ways
of the place, and was most useful in the
house, and took to Belle—and, what was
more important, Belle took to her—immediately.</p>

<p>Far from being set on one side, Betty
was an influential personage, and her
aunt’s domestic viceroy and right hand.
She had not been visible at the tea-table,
simply because she never partook of afternoon
tea. Her Uncle Brian had called it
“a kitchen-maid’s custom,” and she liked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
being out of doors until it was almost
dark. At present she spent all her afternoons
with Miss Dopping, who had been
laid up with a bad cold ever since her
visit to Noone, and Mrs. Redmond gladly
spared her niece, for two reasons; firstly,
because she did not want her; secondly,
because she had her weather-eye fixed on
Miss Dopping’s money bags. The old
lady was fond of Betty, was as wealthy as
she was eccentric, and had no near kin.
If Betty became a rich heiress, it would
be a capital thing for Belle!</p>

<p>George Holroyd had fain to be content
with the Ballingoole Harriers, instead of
the Ward-Union and Meath hounds; his
poverty but not his will consented to this
pitiable change. However, even Harriers
must be followed on horseback, and up
to the present, although the Major had
been making constant enquiries among his
own immediate connections, and many
sporting friends, no suitable steed was
secured. A large number of the blind,
the maimed, the halt, had been forthcoming,
had been submitted for inspection,
each and all a dead bargain, each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
sold as a personal favour to George, and
for <i>no</i> fault, so the Major expressively
stated upon what he was pleased to call
“his sacred word of honour.” George,
who rode well, and recognised a decent
horse when he saw it, at last grew tired
of this farce, and said:</p>

<p>“I always thought that Ireland was
the country for good horses. Where are
they? I never saw such a set of old
screws—that one,” pointing to a discarded
charger, “is like an old hair trunk, and
has not a tooth in his head. My bump
of veneration would forbid my getting
on his back.”</p>

<p>“If you will go to a couple of hundred
guineas,” said the Major (who loved not
his step-son), “I’ll engage to get you a
flyer—a chaser.”</p>

<p>“Thanks—but sixty is my limit, and
as I am a light-weight I ought to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
able to pick up something that will
carry me for a couple of months.”</p>

<p>“There was that bay horse of Cooney’s—he
is cheap enough! You tried him
one day with the Harriers.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I don’t care about an
animal that expects you to carry his
head home, after a very mild day’s sport.”</p>

<p>“Well, I believe I know of one, but
he is a good way off, that won’t ask
you to carry <i>his</i> head, but that takes
it and mostly keeps it. Maybe, he will
please you,” said the Major huffily; “he
belongs to a tenant of me cousin’s, Mick
Malone.”</p>

<p>While this independent animal was
being looked up, George passed his time
in shooting snipe, sunning himself in
Miss Redmond’s smiles, and thinning her
mother’s rabbits. One day, as he was
tramping through the wet woods, accompanied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
by “lodge” Pat, laden with dead
bunnies, he noticed through a glade,
what looked like a black figure—the
figure of a woman. As any figure was
an unusual sight in the upper plantations,
he halted, stared, and finally advanced
towards her—a girl in an old waterproof
and black felt hat, with masses of loose
brown hair, kneeling on the damp moss,
and occasionally laying her head on the
ground! “An escaped lunatic!” Also
two very anxious fox terriers sniffing and
yelping and running circles round her.</p>

<p>“It’s Miss Betty,” ejaculated Pat, and
the sound of his voice made her spring
to her feet, and confront them.</p>

<p>It was Miss Betty, the bath-chair girl;
and how plain she was! Her hair was
tumbling over her shoulders; her face
was deadly white; her eyes dim and
watery with crying; her nose the colour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
of a ripe tomato; an unbecoming old hat;
a raw November day—of a truth, Betty
Redmond had never looked worse!</p>

<p>“Can I be of any assistance? Is anything
the matter?” enquired George
politely, as he doffed his deerstalker.</p>

<p>“Yes, of course there is!” she gasped
out hysterically. “It’s <i>Jones</i>! He has
been in a rabbit-hole since yesterday.”</p>

<p>Mr. Holroyd had never been formally
introduced to the dogs; they were always
out with Betty, and he was more than
ever confirmed in his first impression.</p>

<p>“And Aunt Emma does not care, nor
feel it one bit,” she continued passionately.
“She says he will come out of
himself; perhaps she will be sorry when
he is dead, and she loses his legacy.”</p>

<p>Strange, he thought, that even Maria
Finny had never mentioned that Miss
Elizabeth Redmond was out of her mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span></p>

<p>“Do not excite yourself,” he said,
soothingly. “It will be all right, I am
sure; just leave it in my hands, and I
will see after him—if you will only allow
me to take you home first.”</p>

<p>Could a professional mad doctor say
more? he thought, with warm self-approval.</p>

<p>“Go home,” she echoed, stamping her
foot. “And leave him here to die—he
that is so fond of me—that is my very
shadow—that loves me better than anything
in the world. What do you think
I am made of?—a block of stone? No,
never. I will stay here till he is brought
out, either dead or alive—if I stay for
a week. Well, what are you waiting
for? If you want to be of some use,
you might dig.”</p>

<p>“Sure it’s only a dog, sir,” explained
Pat, as he looked up into his employer’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
sorely perplexed countenance. “It’s only
Jones, and ’tis himself is a born devil
for hunting rabbits, and going to ground
like any ferret.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Holroyd, you offered to help;
help me to dig him out,” said the girl,
seizing a spade. “I will do anything
for you if you will only save him. Pat, I
will give you five shillings! he is choking
in there,” she went on distractedly.
“Listen to his bark, how faint it is,
fainter than it was an hour ago. He
is dying, I am sure of it.” And she
burst into fresh tears.</p>

<p>George Holroyd leant his gun against
a tree, and promptly took hold of a
spade, and commenced operations with a
will. Beauty in distress must ever appeal
to the heart of a young man; only this
was not Beauty—far from it—but Beauty’s
cousin—besides, George loved dogs, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
he worked with all his zeal and strength
for the sake of the sporting little terrier,
whilst Pat laboured and grubbed, and
carried out earth with hard horny hands.
After twenty minutes’ incessant toil,
through moss and roots, and frost-bound
earth, there was a scream of delight from
Betty, and a very dirty, frightened terrier
struggled forth, and was clasped instantly
in her arms.</p>

<p>“Oh, you bad, bad dog,” she murmured
ecstatically, as she kissed the top
of his head: “how dare you give me
such a fright? What should we have
done if you had been lost, and spoiled
the set? You shall be kept in the stable
for a week, on bread and water, for
this.”</p>

<p>And she set him down to receive the
boisterous congratulations of “Brown”
and “Robinson.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t know how to thank you,”
she said, now turning to Mr. Holroyd—“nor
Pat.—Pat, come up to the house
this evening for your five shillings.”</p>

<p>“And my reward,” enquired George.
“I worked twice as hard as Pat!”
Thinking that despite her fiery nose and
eyes, she had pretty white teeth and a
singularly sweet smile. “You know you
said I might have anything I asked for.”</p>

<p>“Oh! that was in the agonies of the
moment!”</p>

<p>“Then you would repudiate your offer.
Miss Betty, I am surprised at you!”</p>

<p>“No, no, I never, as the people here
say, ‘go back from my word;’ only I
have so little worth offering,” now following
happy Pat, who slouched along, laden
with the gun and rabbits. “I have no
possessions of the smallest value, nothing
but an old watch that goes for about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
three hours, and a battered locket, that
Jones has chewed.”</p>

<p>“Well, I will not enforce my claim
now. I shall bide my time, and remind
you of your promise some day. Perhaps
I had better have it down in writing?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you had,” she answered with
a laugh.</p>

<p>“You appear to be very fond of dogs,”
he remarked, as he walked beside her.</p>

<p>“I am indeed. I look upon them almost
as if they were my relations. I have——”
and she paused.</p>

<p>“You were going to say something,”
he suggested politely.</p>

<p>“I have so few relations.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. and Miss Redmond.”</p>

<p>“Very distant connections by marriage.
I have one uncle in India, whom I have
never seen; he is my only near kith
or kin.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span></p>

<p>“Perhaps what you lack in relatives,
you make up in friends; some people
think <i>they</i> are the best of the two.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am very well off for friends—friends
among my school-fellows, and
friends over here—there are the Moores
of Roskeen, and the Mahon girls, and
Miss Dopping, and your sister, Cuckoo.”</p>

<p>“Miss Dopping and Cuckoo! What a
contrast; rather a scratch pair, as the
Major would say.”</p>

<p>“May be so, but they suit me exactly.
Miss Dopping is my house friend, and
Cuckoo is my companion out of doors.”</p>

<p>“And have you summer and winter
friends, and fine weather and wet weather
friends?”</p>

<p>“No, I have <i>no</i> fine weather friend;
you don’t understand. Miss Dopping is
old and does not go out much. She and
I like the same people in books, and we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
read and talk over things, and she tells
me about old times, and teaches me
various matters, and lectures me now and
then.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and Cuckoo? Does she lecture
you and talk about old times?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed, <i>I</i> lecture her; we run
after the Harriers together, and botanise,
and go nutting, and black-berrying.”</p>

<p>George began to think that a walk with
this original girl was an agreeable novelty,
and was rather sorry to see the garden
walls of Noone looming through the trees.
In a narrow path leading from the garden
gate, they nearly fell over Lodge Juggy,
with her apron very full of something,
and if she could be said to blush—she
blushed, as she stood right in their way,
dropping hurried courtesies.</p>

<p>“Oh, Juggy,” exclaimed Betty, “where
are you going; what have you got there?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span></p>

<p>“Just a lock of old cabbage laves for
the pig, miss, that Mike was throwing
out.”</p>

<p>“What small cabbages—they are the
shape of potatoes,” said Betty, looking
steadily at Juggy’s apron.</p>

<p>“Well, there is a couple or so, and I
won’t deny it, miss, but sure, times is
hard, terribly hard, Miss Betty, and <i>you</i>
mind the days when your uncle was alive,
when I went to mass on me own ass’s
car, and kept a couple of pigs!”</p>

<p>“And what has happened to you,
Juggy?” enquired George, sympathetically.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, ever since I offended the
Lord and Mrs. Redmond, I’m in a poor
way. Sure, I get nothing out of the gate,
but what people give me.”</p>

<p>“And I hope they are liberal,” said
George, feeling his pocket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span></p>

<p>“There does be no quality passing
now; times is changed, but some are not
too bad at Christmas. Mrs. Mahon puts
a flannel petticoat on me, and Mrs. Maccabe
puts a couple of shifts on me, and
Miss Dopping puts a pair of boots on me.”</p>

<p>“The Graces attiring Venus,” muttered
the young man to Betty; then louder:</p>

<p>“I hope you will allow me to contribute
to your toilet,” placing five shillings
in her ready hand. “Get yourself one
or two larger and stronger aprons; you
don’t know <i>how</i> useful you may find
them.”</p>

<p>“The Lord love your handsome face!”
exclaimed Juggy, upon whom the sarcasm
was completely lost. “Faix! it’s a real
trate to see a gentleman,” and, as they
passed on, she struck an easy and reflective
attitude, and remarked, in a tone of
audible approval:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span></p>

<p>“Och! and wouldn’t they make a lovely
pair! And wouldn’t I go ten miles on me
hands and knees to see their wedding?”</p>

<p>George could not restrain a smile, at
the preposterous idea of coupling <i>him</i> with
his present companion.</p>

<p>“What does she mean about offending
Mrs. Redmond and the Lord?” he enquired
precipitately—trusting that Juggy’s
compliments had not reached Betty’s ears.</p>

<p>“Oh! it’s a long story. She has lived
at the lodge for years, and some of her
people are not quite respectable. One of
her brothers is a poacher, and another
keeps a still. She used to sell his potheen
on the sly, and I often wondered
<i>why</i> she had so many visitors, especially
on Sundays, in Uncle Brian’s time, for
he was an indulgent master, and seemed
to think what he called ‘Juggy’s receptions’
a great joke, but last year she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
quarrelled with Foxy Joe—you know
Foxy Joe?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am acquainted with him.”</p>

<p>“Well, I believe they had some dispute
about money, or whisky, and he
informed on her, and told Aunt Emma
that she kept a very thriving unlicensed
‘public’ at the lodge gate, and so, one
day, when Juggy declared that she was
dying of rheumatism and cold, and had
sent up to her house for port wine and
a little jam, Aunt Emma marched down
to the lodge, about twelve o’clock at
night, and made <i>me</i> go with her. We
peeped in at one of the front windows,
and saw the whole kitchen lit up. One
of the best drawing-room lamps was on
the dresser, four silver candlesticks had
also been borrowed, as well as glasses,
and the family punch-bowl, and Mrs.
Redmond’s pet claret jug. About fifty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
people were sitting round, drinking and
smoking, and shouting ‘more power.’
There was a fiddler on the table, and
Juggy herself and the Mahons’ groom
were dancing a frantic jig in the middle
of the floor. When Mrs. Redmond flung
the door back and stalked in, perhaps
you can imagine the scene, for it is beyond
my power of description.”</p>

<p>“I think I can picture it,” said George
with a hearty laugh. “Tell me, Miss
Betty, how is it that I never see you
at Noone? And do you know that I
am over almost every afternoon?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I am aware of that, but I
have had other engagements. Have you
been thinking that I am a sort of Cinderella,
hidden in the kitchen among the
ashes?” she enquired mischievously.</p>

<p>“No,” he stammered; but the idea had
occurred to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t drink five o’clock tea, and I
generally go over and sit with Miss Dopping,
who has been ill; besides, I know
that Belle is a host in herself.”</p>

<p>(She said this in the frank innocence
of her heart, and without the faintest
<i>arrière pensée</i>.)</p>

<p>“The more the merrier,” returned George,
“we shall have your society this evening
at any rate.”</p>

<p>“No, I think not. I have a message
to take for Mrs. Redmond. You see,
Jones has wasted nearly all my day,”
and she came to a full stop where the
pathway led to the avenue.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, then,” he said, “since you
must go, and remember your promise.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll remember my promise,” she
answered gaily. “I am very, very much
obliged to you,” and she held out her
hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span></p>

<p>He took it in his. What a cold, slender,
little hand! It gave him a grateful, cordial
shake, like a hearty schoolboy, and
in another second its proprietor had disappeared
in the deepening dusk.</p>

<p>And so that was Betty! who came
into a room like a blast of wind, according
to Major Malone, and whom his mother
had called “a beautiful, warm-hearted,
young creature.” Well, on the whole,
he rather liked her.</p>

</div>

<p>“A horse, a horse! My kingdom for a horse.”</p>


<p>“Miss Dopping’s cold had taken a terrible
strong hold of her,” according to the maid
who issued bulletins at her hall door,
and she sat cowering over the fire in
what she called her “museum,” wrapped
in a woollen shawl, munching liquorice
ball, and reminding herself that she was
seventy-five years of age, and could not
expect to live for ever!</p>

<p>Each afternoon Betty had appeared,
escorted by her dogs, all brisk and
cheerful, and, whilst Brown ate biscuits,
and Jones conscientiously drew
the room for mice, Betty read aloud,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
wound worsted, answered letters, and
amused her; but to-day, thanks to
Jones’s misadventure, there was no
Betty, and the old lady was feeling unusually
low and forlorn. Her drawing-room
(or museum) was a strange apartment
for an elderly spinster. If you
were told that it was the sanctum of a
sporting squire, you would not have been
surprised, for it was essentially a man’s
room, from the tanned skins of defunct
hunters spread about the floor, the walls
covered with brushes, horse shoes, and
sporting prints (prints setting forth
slender-waisted riders, charging impossible
rails on short-tailed thoroughbreds, or
spanking coaches-and-four, or flat races)
to the venerable old fox-hound, dozing
on the rug.</p>

<p>Miss Sally Dopping came of a very
horsey family, and had ruled her father’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
sporting establishment for many years;
but he had been cut off by a coaching
accident, and her only brother had broken
his neck in a steeplechase. The Doppings
generally met their deaths by flood or
field; a natural death in a four-poster
would be an unnatural death to them.
Miss Sally herself had followed the
hounds with reckless persistence, in a
black skirt and scarlet jacket; delighting
the male sex, and horrifying their wives
and daughters, for a fox-hunting lady
was not a common or popular spectacle
fifty years ago; but Miss Sally did not
care a button for the local Mrs. Grundy.
She swallowed a bowl of strong broth
at eight o’clock in the morning, and set
off on her well-bred, rat-tailed hunter, to
the nearest meet, and enjoyed herself
vastly. She paid ceremonious visits to
her neighbours, in her mother’s old green<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
chariot, and was quite as stiff and snubby
to them as they were to her. Indeed, to
tell the truth, they were all afraid to say
much to her <i>face</i>—and she feared no one—for
Sally had the reputation of having
a high temper, and, it was whispered,
had once boxed another lady’s ears. She
was an old woman now, who had out-lived
her generation and her relations,
and was never known to lift her hand to
mortal, merely contenting herself with
speaking her mind <i>quite</i> plainly, and
going her own way. There were no
traces of “Galloping Sal” in the wealthy
old maid, beyond that she was still an
excellent judge of a horse, and had been
known, under strong provocation, to rap
out a full-bodied oath. Despite her eccentricities
(which were not a few—she used
a toothpick, rarely wore a cap, and had
been seen sitting with her feet on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
chimneypiece), she was very popular
among the county people, and in great
request at their hospitable houses, and
took a far higher social position than
miserly Mrs. Redmond, or meek Mrs.
Malone, even although she lived in the
<i>town</i>! People said that she and old Brian
Redmond had been lovers once, but that
they had fallen out over a horse, and
that that was the reason of her strong
partiality for Betty; but some people
will say anything.</p>

<p>“Was that Betty’s knock?” she said to
herself.</p>

<p>No, “Bachelor” never growled at
Betty’s step! It was Maria Finny in
a damp waterproof, who, noting from
over her blind that Miss Dopping’s daily
visitor had failed her, ran over to see
how she was getting on?</p>

<p>“Oh, well, I am just getting on like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
all of us. <i>You</i> are getting on yourself,
Maria.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she admitted, as she removed
her cloak, and drew near the fire. “But
I am not getting on like Belle Redmond.
I should be sorry to be a town’s talk like
her.”</p>

<p>“The town is always ready to talk.
I’ve a mind to buy a flaxen wig and a
pair of pink tights, and give it something
to gabble about in earnest. Well,
and what has Belle been doing now?”</p>

<p>“She has that young Holroyd there
every day of his life,” returned Maria,
who, having a budget of news, was
speechfully happy.</p>

<p>“Pooh, what rubbish; he has only
been here ten days, and, may be, he
has nowhere else to go to—or perhaps
you expect him to hang up his hat in
<i>your</i> hall, Maria.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span></p>

<p>“No, Miss Dopping, you know I do
not, but he is a nice gentlemanly young
man, and, surely to goodness, you would
not like to see him ruined for life! He
has been very liberal to his mother. She
was down the street paying bills a few
days after he came. I saw her myself,
going into Maccabe’s and Casey’s, and
she has not faced <i>them</i> for months.”</p>

<p>“Then why the deuce doesn’t she look
after her son? What is the fool of a
woman about? If he marries, she has
seen the last of his money, and most
likely the last of <i>him</i>.”</p>

<p>“And don’t you know Mrs. Malone by
this time?” enquired Maria contemptuously—“a
poor helpless creature, all
her mind is set on making things pleasant
for Mr. Holroyd, keeping him and the
Major on good terms, and hiding Denis
and his doings from them both.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span></p>

<p>“Will you tell me one thing, Maria
Finny—<i>you</i> know what goes on in the
town, if any one does. Since I am confined
to the house, I am a good deal at
the window.”</p>

<p>“You always <i>are</i>,” interrupted Maria,
with her usual acid frankness. Maria
neither gave nor accepted quarter. “The
song—‘Only a Face at the Window,’
was surely made about you.”</p>

<p>“Tell me, Maria, what is Denis doing
in Maccabe’s? He is in and out there
like a dog in a fair. If it was a <i>public</i>, I
could understand it, but butchers’ meat
throws me fairly off the scent.”</p>

<p>“Off the scent, are you? And hasn’t
Mrs. Maccabe more than beef and mutton
in her shop? Hasn’t she a pretty
niece?”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, Maria! hold your blistering,
scurrilous tongue,” said the old lady,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
pushing her chair back, with great
violence.</p>

<p>“Tongue, or no tongue, I’ve an eye in
my head,” returned Maria undauntedly.
“Lizzie is one of your still waters, with
her sleek hair, and downcast eyes, and
‘yes, Miss Finny,’ and ‘no, Miss Finny’—scarcely
above her breath. She is as
deep as a draw-well. I saw Denis and
her walking together in the bog road last
Sunday.”</p>

<p>“Then, by my oath, if her aunt knew
it, she would just flay her alive,” said
Miss Dopping, excitedly.</p>

<p>“I daresay she would! But never
mind Lizzie just now; trust me, there
will be enough about <i>her</i> by and by, or
I am much mistaken. Do you know
that the Major is going on with his
tricks, and his betting, worse than ever?
Jane Bolland says that he sends as many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
as six telegrams a day—and always about
racing. There will be a fine ruction
there soon, and George Holroyd will
have to support the whole family. If
he marries Belle Redmond, he will have
his hands full. When she is in a
passion, she is like a madwoman; she
threw a lighted candle at Katey Brady,
they say, for spoiling a petticoat, and
indeed I think there must be a touch of
madness in the family. She is so restless,
and fond of gay colours, and has
the eyes and laugh of a woman who
would go out of her mind for very little.
I pity George Holroyd.”</p>

<p>“He will never marry her, Maria,”
rejoined Miss Dopping emphatically.</p>

<p>“<i>She</i> will marry him, and it comes to
the same thing,” returned Maria, with
great determination. “They have a fire
in the drawing-room every day, and she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
wears her best clothes, and walks back
with him through the woods with a
shawl over her head, leaning on his arm
too! and is always sending him notes by
Foxy Joe. I went over there myself
one day, with a collecting card; of
course <i>that</i> was a fool’s errand! but I
wanted to see how the land lay, and indeed,”
with a sniff of virtuous scorn, “I
saw enough! I wonder if Mr. Holroyd
knows about that officer in the Sky
Blues!”</p>

<p>“Not he,” replied Miss Dopping in her
sharpest key. “If he must take a wife
from Noone, why does he not take
Betty?”</p>

<p>“Betty! that wild slip, running about
the country with Cuckoo, after every old
fern, and fossil?”</p>

<p>“And is it not more respectable than
to be running after a young man?” enquired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
the other forcibly. “She is
eighteen, she is well educated, and she
really <i>is</i> a lady.”</p>

<p>“She is only an awkward slip of a
girl; her eyes and hair are not too bad,
but <i>I</i> call her very plain, with her thin
cheeks and pasty face.”</p>

<p>“Plain!” echoed Miss Dopping,
shrilly.</p>

<p>“Yes, and what else?” retorted Maria,
stoutly.</p>

<p>“Just listen to <i>me</i>, Maria. Old Robert
Lynch, who was a terrible man for the
ladies in his day, and the best of judges,
saw her once, and said that in a year or
two, she will be able to give two stone
and a beating to any girl in the country.
He said he would keep his eye on her.”</p>

<p>“I would not doubt him, the old
scamp! Bob Lynch ought to be
thinking of his sins, and of his latter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
end, instead of talking trash,” said
Maria, severely. “However, Betty is not
out yet.”</p>

<p>“And when she does come out,” retorted
her champion, “you’ll find there
will be a half-a-dozen young men waiting
on the steps to marry her—and so
George is at Noone every day?”</p>

<p>“Yes, for hours,” replied Miss Finny,
in a tone that was almost tragic.</p>

<p>“Well, I see only two chances for
him—and they are either to break his
neck, or to run away from that scheming,
brazen creature.”</p>

<p>“I know he is asked to Goole for the
cock shooting, and to the Kanes’ for
hunting,” continued Maria confidentially,
“for Jane Bolland noticed the postmarks
and crests. It is a grand thing for a
young man to come into this part of the
world, where bachelors are scarce and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
girls are in dozens. Mrs. Malone showed
me a whole row of notes, waiting for him
on the chimneypiece, and really, the first
Sunday he was in church, the way the
girls flocked round him afterwards—by
the way of speaking to his mother—was
shameless! The Rodes, the Lynches,
and the Wildes, that scarcely look at her
from year’s end to year’s end.”</p>

<p>“Why does he not go off hunting?”
enquired Miss Dopping. “He must be
a queer sort of a molly-coddle of a young
man, if <i>that</i> does not tempt him.”</p>

<p>“He has no horse yet; the Major has
been trying to sell him every old screw
in the country, but he is too sharp for
him and so——”</p>

<p>“And so he goes over and idles, and
risks himself at Noone; I see. Well, he
is a pleasant young fellow, and was very
civil, even to an old hag like me, so I’ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
do my best for him. I will get the
Moores to ask him over, and I’ll speak
a word to the Major! And now, Maria,
that will do for to-day. I am not very
strong, and a little of <i>you</i> goes a long
way. There is your cloak, there is your
umbrella; good-bye, and don’t bang the
front-door.”</p>

<p>As soon as the same door had been
shut, with a violence that shook the
plaster from the ceiling (for Maria
was not pleased), Miss Dopping hurried
over to the seat she always occupied in
the window, drew her shawl over her
head, and peered into the street. She
frequently sat in this nook, watching
passers-by, and knocked loudly on the
pane at any she specially wished to see,
usually—almost always—<i>men</i>. She
vastly preferred their society to that of
her own sex, and openly gloried in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
fact. Major Malone, Dr. Doran, Sir
Forbes Gould, Lord Mudrath, the Parish
Priest, were indiscriminately summoned
in from time to time, to have a talk and
a glass of good wine—and came right
willingly. She was an aggressively hospitable
old lady. No one was permitted
to leave her house without partaking of
some refreshment, whether it was port
wine and a biscuit, a cup of tea and seed
cake, or even a glass of milk! To
refuse was to offend her seriously. The
very drivers who brought her visitors on
hack cars were sure of a bottle of porter.
Eating and drinking was in her opinion,
an outward and visible token of inward
goodwill. Now she sits in the window,
watching for the Major, and here he comes
at last, rolling out of the post office. She
rapped at him sharply with her knuckles,
and soon afterwards his red face, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
ample waistcoat, presented themselves in
the doorway.</p>

<p>“Sit down, Major,” said his hostess
effusively, “sit down; come over near
the fire and tell me all the news. You
are a great stranger these times, a great
stranger.”</p>

<p>“Upon my word, Miss Sally,” rubbing
his hands briskly, “I haven’t a word of
news, good or bad. Have you?”</p>

<p>“What! and you only just out of the
post office! Oh! come, come. Have
you heard that your step-son is making
great running over at Noone? How
would you like Belle for a daughter-in-law?”</p>

<p>“Faith,” drawing forth and flourishing
a silk handkerchief, “I admire his
taste.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s more than I do,” said Miss
Dopping acrimoniously; “an idle, useless,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
ornamental hussey, that never gets out of
bed till twelve in the day, and that can’t
do a hand’s turn beyond trimming a
bonnet, and squalling French songs—and
I am not saying <i>anything</i> about her temper.
However, he has private means and
he will want them all——”</p>

<p>“Oh, he is not serious,” interrupted
the Major, speaking hastily, and with
visible alarm. “There is nothing in it,
upon my sacred word of honour. Of
course, he admires Belle, we all do; he
is not a marrying man; he has no idea
of marrying.”</p>

<p>“But <i>she</i> has, and he is always there,
singing and tea-drinking; more by token
he has nothing else to do.”</p>

<p>“I’m after a horse for him, but he is
so plaguey hard to please.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he’s not to be pleased with one
of your old garrons; and let me tell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
you this, Tom Malone, that if you can’t
put your hand on something better
soon, it’s a lady’s hack he will be
wanting.”</p>

<p>“I see,” nodding his head several times.
“The wind of the word is enough for
Tom Malone. I’ll write to my cousin to-night.
I don’t want the poor fellow to
be hooked like that,” he added, with a
keen sense of favours to come. “I’ll
write——No, by Jove, as I am near the
post office, I’ll telegraph! I’ll just run
over now.”</p>

<p>The Major’s running was of course a
mere figure of speech, a sort of hurried
waddle; he lost no time and clattered
downstairs, and speedily despatched the
following message to his cousin, Mike
Malone:</p>

<p>“Rail at once your artillery mare, or
Clancy’s colt. Leave price to me. Guarantee<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
satisfaction”; to which an answer
came that same evening: “Mare sold, am
sending Clancy’s colt.”</p>

<p>Behold a lovely morning in late November—a
morning borrowed from Spring, as
bright and sunny as if it had been
advanced by the liberal month of May.
True, that as yet there had been but
little frost, that the South of Ireland is
proverbially mild, and the pleasure-ground
at Bridgetstown a notoriously sheltered
and favoured spot. Chrysanthemums—yellow
and brown—still braved the nipping
wintry air, hollyhocks, dahlias, and
pale monthly roses as yet held up their
heads; laurels and holly glistened in
seasonable green, and a gorgeous Virginia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
creeper flaunted along the grey garden
wall.</p>

<p>On such a morning, George Holroyd
came whistling across the pleasure-ground
in search of his mother. She was extremely
fond of flowers, and if hoarding
up shilling to shilling was Mrs. Redmond’s
passion, and deepest earthly enjoyment,
grubbing, transplanting, nursing, and potting
was hers. George swung back the
garden gate, till it shivered on its hinges,
and beheld his mother, and a tall girl,
promenading along the central gravel
walk. His mother was leaning upon her
companion’s arm, and carried an earthy
trowel in one hand—they were evidently
engaged in earnest conversation. On hearing
the gate slam, they both turned
towards him, and could it be possible
that his mother’s <i>confidante</i> was Betty
Redmond? For a moment he doubted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
her identity, so great was the difference
between smiles and tears—between a
wild rose complexion and a countenance
sodden and swollen with crying—between
a dull misty afternoon, and a brilliant
morning. The sun brought out the bronze
tints of Betty’s brown hair, and was
reflected in the depths of her deep grey
eyes—eyes of that mystic shade, that can
be soft with joy or love, brimming with
sympathy, dancing with mirth, or dark
as night with grief or jealousy. Such
eyes are wont to dazzle, and into their
depths it is most dangerous for a young
man to gaze, unless he would be their
slave for life. Luckily for mankind, the
power of these eyes was unknown to
their possessor; to her, they were merely
a pair of useful organs, that saw well,
slept well, and wept well—to the latter
George Holroyd could bear testimony.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
Betty had discarded her waterproof, and
wore a well-fitting blue serge gown, a
black straw sailor’s hat, in which was
jauntily stuck two bits of scarlet geranium,
the very last of the season. She was tall
and slight, and as George looked, he
agreed with his mother—Betty Redmond
was beautiful. Hers was a style that
bore a searching light, the open air, the
bold unflattering sun. Belle looked best
in dim rose-shaded lamplight, or within
the circuit of a fire, whose blaze was reproduced
in her magnificent dark orbs.
Belle was a brilliant hot-house azalea,
and Betty a bit of white mountain
heather.</p>

<p>It is true that her nose was not as
neatly chiselled as her cousin’s, and that
her small white teeth were somewhat
irregular; nevertheless Betty was a pretty
girl and found great favour in George<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
Holroyd’s eyes; but whether she was a
“warm-hearted young creature” he had
yet to discover.</p>

<p>“This is my son, George,” explained
Mrs. Malone proudly. “George, don’t
you know Betty? I mean Miss Elizabeth
Redmond.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied George. “I have already
had the pleasure of making her acquaintance.
I helped her to excavate a treasure
in the upper wood at Noone.”</p>

<p>Betty coloured to her brow, for his
eyes were looking straight into hers, with
an expression that confused and vexed her—an
expression of undisguised admiration.</p>

<p>“I am fortunate in meeting you, Miss
Betty,” he continued, “for it strikes me,
that we are like the little couple in the
weather-glass house: when I am here, you
are at Noone; when I am at Noone, you
are here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span></p>

<p>“I come over to read with Cuckoo two
mornings a week; we take it month
about—it is my turn to come to her,”
returned the girl, looking at him steadily.</p>

<p>If Mr. Holroyd was going to stare at
her in that odd way, she would dislike
him extremely. Mr. Holroyd read her
haughty young face like a book. What a
pretty mouth and chin she had—a pretty
mouth that looked as if it could speak
proud things!</p>

<p>“I wish you would allow me to come
and do lessons with you,” he returned
with a smile. “I am shockingly ignorant,
my spelling is shaky, and my geography
deplorable.”</p>

<p>“I think it more likely we should
learn from you; you have seen so much
of the world, and so many strange places
and people, I am sure you could teach
us a great deal.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span></p>

<p>“I could teach you Hindustani and the
new sword exercise, and how to load
cartridges.”</p>

<p>“Ah! I am afraid that your instruction
would be wasted on us,” she answered,
looking after Mrs. Malone, who had been
hurried off to the hotbed by Joe the
gardener.</p>

<p>“May I ask what you are doing?” he
enquired, glancing at a hammer and some
pieces of scarlet cloth she held in her hand.
“Have you been cutting up the Major’s
uniform?”</p>

<p>“I have been nailing up the Cloth of
Gold rose, which the wind has blown down;
but you see there are some trails that I
could not reach,” pointing to them as she
spoke.</p>

<p>In another instant, George was on the
ladder, receiving nails and bits of cloth, and
particular directions, gazing down into a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
pair of beautiful upturned eyes. The full
effect of a pair of exquisite upturned eyes
must be experienced to be appreciated!
George studied them gravely. Something
told him that it was no ordinary maiden
who held the ladder; he must not flirt
with this innocent inexperienced girl. No,
no; Honour stood by with her finger on
her lips.</p>

<p>“You seem to know your way about
here pretty well,” he observed, <i>apropos</i> of
Bridgetstown, when they had conversed
with frank companionship for some time.</p>

<p>“Yes, I am quite at home. I have been
coming here since I was a little thing.
Your mother calls me her eldest daughter.”</p>

<p>“Then I am your brother, of course.”</p>

<p>“No, no, that does not follow by any
means; you are a stranger at Ballingoole.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know I am only a mere Englishman,
but I hope I shall be presented with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
the freedom of the town. Mrs. Finny
assures me that I am an honoured and distinguished
visitor.”</p>

<p>“What would be the good of the freedom
of the town? It is a stagnant little place;
we have no excitements; and you are a
soldier—a wanderer on the face of the
earth.”</p>

<p>“That is true, I am a rolling stone, and
don’t care much about the moss.”</p>

<p>“You like the life, then?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I could not conceive any other; it
suits me down to the ground.”</p>

<p>“And what will you do when you are
what the Major calls ‘kicked out?’”</p>

<p>“I am sure I don’t know; loaf round, I
suppose, until it is time to die!”</p>

<p>“And how did you like Mrs. Finny?”
enquired Betty with a sly smile; “did she
made you any sweet speeches?”</p>

<p>“She made me <i>blush!</i> a thing I have not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
done for years! Butter should be applied
in small quantities, with a delicate silver
knife, and not administered by the half-pound
with a trowel. However, it pleased
my mother.”</p>

<p>“<i>Only</i> your mother?” with merry incredulous
eyes.</p>

<p>“Yes, my sensitive nature, and highly-strung
nerves——”</p>

<p>“Your what?” she interrupted, and
they both burst out laughing. Mrs.
Malone heard the laugh, at the bottom of
the garden—and was delighted to think
that her handsome soldier son and her
favourite visitor were getting on so well.</p>

<p>At this instant the garden gate again
opened with a clang, and admitted the
graceful and vivacious Cuckoo.</p>

<p>“George!” she screamed. “Oh! there
you are; what <i>are</i> you doing up the
ladder?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span></p>

<p>“Looking for birds’ nests, as you may
see!”</p>

<p>“Cuckoo!” exclaimed Betty tragically,
“it is not <i>possible</i> that you are out in your
new shoes?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m in a hurry. I have something
to tell George, something he would
like to hear. Only he is so rude that I
think I shall keep him waiting, marking
time, as <i>he</i> calls it.”</p>

<p>“I rude!” he echoed; “my good Cuckoo,
you are joking.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you know you called me a little
pig only yesterday.”</p>

<p>“But of course I meant a <i>pretty</i> little
pig,” he rejoined as he carefully selected a
nail, and drove it into the wall. “What
are your tidings, fairest of the fair?”</p>

<p>“A horse has come for you—such a
beauty?”</p>

<p>“By Jove, you don’t say so!” jumping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
down as he spoke. “Everything comes to
him who waits!”</p>

<p>“Yes. But I heard the man that
brought him telling Knox, not to go
near his heels, for he was a born devil,
but that the Major wouldn’t mind <i>that</i>,
and he winked; why did he wink,
George?”</p>

<p>“Where did he come from?” enquired
her brother as eagerly as a boy of ten.
“He is not an old friend, is he?”</p>

<p>“He came from near Cousin Mick’s; he
belongs to a man named Clancy—a tenant
of his.”</p>

<p>“Let us go and inspect him, instantly,
Miss Redmond, that is if you care about
looking at him; but any one who is so
devoted to dogs <i>must</i> be fond of horses.”</p>

<p>Betty admitted the impeachment, and
they hurried towards the house, whilst
Cuckoo went shrieking down the garden:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
“Mother! mother! come and look at
George’s new horse.”</p>

<p>In a very short time, the whole establishment
was collected on the lawn, surveying
the recent arrival, with critical eyes. The
Major with his legs very wide apart, and
a toothpick in his mouth, carried on a
whispered conversation with a pale-faced
little man, in extraordinary tight trousers,
now holding his head this side, and now
on that, like a crow peeping down a marrow
bone.</p>

<p>Every male about the place, from the
groom to the message boy, was assembled
in solemn conclave, for is not every
Irishman born into the world with “an eye
for a horse?”</p>

<p>The animal under inspection came out
of the ordeal nobly. He proved to be
young, well-bred, and sound; a fine upstanding
iron grey, five off, with lots of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
bone below the knee, plenty of room for his
bellows, and grand quarters.</p>

<p>And although Sam the groom said, “his
colour was against him,” and Tom, the
message boy, “suspicioned him of a
splint,” and he had not “sufficient quality”
to please Joe the gardener, yet on the
whole, the verdict was in his favour, and
he was pronounced to be “a shocking
fine colt.”</p>

<p>But his price! Well his price was surprisingly
low, and was possibly accounted
for by his rolling eye, and extremely animated
manners.</p>

<p>According to the little wizened groom
who led him (by preference) “he was an
outrageous lepper, and could jump a town,
was never known to turn his head from
anything, and had a cruel turn of speed.”</p>

<p>Being requested to canter him quietly
round the lawn, and exhibit his paces, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
refused with considerable decision. He declared
that he had the lumbago so badly he
could not sit in a saddle, and had not been
on a horse’s back for months.</p>

<p>“Let the gentleman throw a leg across
the harse, and try him for himself.”</p>

<p>The gentleman, who was greatly taken
with the animal, was nothing loth, and
promptly advanced to mount him.</p>

<p>“Take him aisy, your honour,” muttered
the groom, as he let down the stirrup
leathers. “Take him kindly, he is young,
and ye must just <i>flatter</i> him a bit at the
first go off.”</p>

<p>But the horse scornfully refused to be taken
aisy or flattered. He had been standing
for some time, and was possibly cold, and
certainly impatient; he had not been
ridden for weeks (for reasons known to his
groom).</p>

<p>Consequently when he was mounted and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
let go, he lashed out with his heels in a
manner that rapidly scattered his admirers,
made two vicious buck jumps, and then
bolted; going immediately down the
avenue, at the rate of twenty miles an
hour.</p>

<p>“And the gate is shut!” gasped Mrs.
Malone, as she clutched Betty’s arm, convulsively;
“the gate—the iron gate.”</p>

<p>Betty stood still and held her breath;
they all stood and gazed, in expectation
of some horrible catastrophe; for the
avenue gate was over four feet high,
with strong spikes along the top bar.</p>

<p>“Thank God,” exclaimed Mrs. Malone,
breaking a painful silence, as the grey,
who had a fall of the ground with him,
sailed over it like a deer.</p>

<p>“At laste he can lep,” remarked Sam
the groom, wiping the perspiration off
his forehead with his sleeve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span></p>

<p>“And where is he <i>now</i>?” asked the
Major in an angry voice.</p>

<p>“He is away up the Roskeen Road,”
shouted Tom, who had swarmed up a
tree. “Faix, he nearly did it <i>that</i> time;
he was just into Mrs. Maccabe’s cart.
Hurroo! the Captain has got a pull at
him, and is taking him across country,
he—he has gone slap through Dooley’s
haggard and potato garden, and begorra,—now,
now he is making for the
canal.”</p>

<p>And with this cheering announcement,
Tom climbed down, declaring that he could
see nothing more.</p>

<p>In less than half-an-hour George and
the grey came trotting back, intact, and
apparently on the best of terms with one
another, although they were both very
hot; the grey had lost two shoes, and
his rider his cap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span></p>

<p>“He has no more mouth than a stone
wall,” said George as he got off. “But
he <i>can’t</i> fall. He took Dooley’s boundary
as if it were a cart rut. I’ve knocked
the conceit out of him a bit; he was
heading for the canal, but when he found
it was all the same to me, he shut off
steam.”</p>

<p>“George, my dear boy, what a terrible
horse!” cried Mrs. Malone. “I was sure
you would have been killed, when he
went at the gate.”</p>

<p>“Yes, like the old lady I thought that
‘every moment would be my next,’ till
I discovered that he could jump. He is
all right, mother, he only wants exercise,
there is no fear of me. And I mean to
buy him.”</p>

<p>“Your father was a splendid rider,
George; no horse ever conquered him.
You take after him, I see.” And she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
looked at her handsome, eager-eyed son
with an air of melancholy pride.</p>

<p>“What do <i>you</i> say to him, Miss
Betty?” he enquired. “You shall ride
him if you like, some of these days,
when he is better bitted, and broken.”</p>

<p>“Betty is a nailer to ride. She’d back
anything,” volunteered Denis in his gruff
voice.</p>

<p>“He is not a lady’s horse,” objected
the Major, “though handling and exercise
is all he wants. Only for this gout of
mine I’d buy him myself, and have him as
quiet as a sheep by the end of the week;
it’s all hands, sir, hands—and I don’t think
much of <i>yours</i>. Eh! what? what?”</p>

<p>The Major was sorely vexed at George’s
success, and the unmistakable admiration
that his riding had evoked, from a notoriously
critical class. The Major himself
was no horseman; a lamentable exhibition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
in the saddle; he had a capital seat in
a dog-cart, that was all.</p>

<p>Presently, as the cowed and subdued
grey was about to be led off to the
stable, with drooping head and heaving
sides, Cuckoo rushed at the groom excitedly,
and said:</p>

<p>“You have not told us his name.
What is he called?”</p>

<p>“Faix! the only name I ever heard
put on him was Clancy’s mad colt, but
I believe he was christened ‘Scatter
Brains,’” replied the little man with a
sly smile as he led his charge away, to
have a rub down and a feed.</p>

<p>That evening “Scatter Brains” was
purchased by George Holroyd for seventy-five
guineas, and a luckpenny to the
groom, who received it, and a glass of
whisky, with an expression of intense
satisfaction—not to say relief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span></p>

<p>“You are not from this part of the
world, are you?” enquired George by
way of conversation.</p>

<p>“No, your honour, I was formerly a
native of Cork, and I would not tell your
honour a lie.”</p>

<p>“And of where are you <i>now</i> a
native?”</p>

<p>“Well—I’ve been at Clancy’s this
fifteen years. I see you can ride, sir,”
he continued confidentially. “So I’ve
no shame or fear in telling you, that
that horse requires a power of humouring.
I’ve never walked straight since the last
time he got shut of me. We are not
sorry to part with him; he has a desperate
trick of bolting, and for nothing
at all! When you are just walking
innocently along the road, he is away
with you. He has a terrible bad name,
and that’s why ye got him chape; they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
does be all in dread of him! But there
is just wan resource, for a man with
nerve, and I’ll tell it to you. Pretend
you <i>like</i> it—I never could—and that
will cure him. When he bolts with
hounds (as in course he always does),
and mostly lames a couple of dogs, stick
in the spurs, and lam into him with a
<i>new</i> ashplant, until he is fit to drop, just
give him his head, <i>and</i> the stick: he could
not fall if he tried, and when ye feel him
under you, just devouring the ground,
and greedy to be airing himself over an
eighteen foot gripe and double, ye would
not grudge three hundred sovereigns; he
is a chaser, that’s what <i>he is</i>, and invaluable
to a stout rider, a bold man
like yourself—but many and many’s the
time I thought he would make a ghost
of <i>me</i>.”</p>

<p>“And have you lost your nerve?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span></p>

<p>“Between ourselves, sir,” lowering his
voice, “I have; I haven’t a pinch left.
I’ve scarcely a whole bone in me skin.
I was first a riding boy, and then a
jock, and then a breaker-in, and I have
had some extraordinary bad falls. Well,
sir, since you <i>are</i> so pressing, I’ll take
just another tinte of whisky, and wishing
long life and good luck to your honour,
and many a good day on the grey,” and
so somewhat unsteadily departed.</p>

</div>


<p>Shortly after his purchase of “Scatter
Brains,” Mr. Holroyd appeared at a popular
meet of the Harriers, got up in unimpeachable
boots and breeches, but somewhat
spoiling the effect, by carrying the
prescribed ashplant. He and his mount
were critically scanned by the sporting
community—who sat ranged along the
top of a low wall, bordering the road,
and subsequently pursued on foot.</p>

<p>The grey horse was unanimously approved
of, “passed,” and pronounced to
be a grand one and a goer, and invidious
comparisons were audibly drawn between
him and an old “Stageen,” on which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
another gentleman was mounted. All at
once, a shrill gossoon exclaimed, as if
announcing a most portentous discovery:</p>

<p>“I have it, boys! May I never ate,
bite, or sup, if it isn’t Clancy’s grey.”</p>

<p>“Clancy’s grey,” echoed another voice,
“that he has been striving to sell this
two year and more! Oh, the poor, innocent,
young English officer!” then in
a louder key to George, “Don’t be riding
<i>too</i> far from a churchyard, yer honour!”</p>

<p>“Is there a doctor out the day?”
enquired a third pleasantly.</p>

<p>“Mother av Moses! why didn’t ye
bring your coffin with ye?”</p>

<p>So far “Clancy” (as he was called,
the other name being too suggestive) had
been behaving amazingly well, merely
snorting and glaring and prancing; even
as they trotted up the soft green fields
to draw the furrows, he only moved as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
if stepping upon hot bricks, with now
and then a sidle and a squeal. But once
the hare was found, and there was a
bustle, and a rush forward at a narrow
razor bank, with a big gripe on the near
side, he cocked his ears, and practically
took leave of the field, as if he had urgent
private affairs, going at racing pace,
and carrying his rider over it before he
had time to breathe. He soon outpaced
the furious huntsman, and the fleeting
hounds, lastly the hare, and was making
with all speed for his stable at Bridgetstown.
He jumped very big, and appeared
to know all about it, and as the
fences seemed sound, George sat down in
his saddle, and let him have it with the
ashplant! A wilder career was seldom
seen. “Clancy” tore along like a thing
possessed, flying over hedges, till they
seemed to whizz past. Once or twice,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
he landed on his nose, but struggled up
in a second, and was going again as hard
as ever. Cuckoo, Betty, and Denis,
posted on a neighbouring hill, with an
old red spy-glass, watched his headlong
course, with breathless interest.</p>

<p>“There he is in Hourrigan’s land, and
now he is over Murphy’s boundary,”
shouted Denis slapping his leg; “that
horse would win the Liverpool if he was
put in training!—why, he is making for
those boggy fields near the canal. He
had better mind himself. Whew! there
he goes in plump, <i>that</i> will cook his
goose, and unless I am much mistaken,
he will lay down his knife and fork!”</p>

<p>George had been prepared for this
emergency, and had taken his feet out of
the stirrups, and when his somewhat
blown hunter skimmed a low bank, and
landed in what <i>looked</i> like beautiful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
green grass, but was really soft treacherous
bog, he was off his back in an
instant. “Clancy” struggled madly,
snorted and panted with fear, but the
more he struggled the deeper he sank;
in a very short time he was up to his
girths. “You want a lesson, my friend,”
remarked his master, calmly lighting a
cigarette. “A nice condition my boots
are in! You must learn that this unpleasant
state of affairs is the natural
result of running away, and that it is
my turn now.”</p>

<p>At length, when the grey was completely
exhausted, and had subsided so
much that his situation began to be a
little precarious, his owner had compassion
on him, and he and Denis, and
a couple of labouring men, with ropes,
helped him out, a shameful, pitiful spectacle,
a black horse with a grey head!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
He appeared to feel his position very
keenly, skulking home along the edge
of the roads with his tail tucked between
his legs, as if saying to the hedges,
“<i>Hide me!</i>”</p>

<p>After this experience, “Clancy” became
a comparatively reformed character,
and merely amused himself with prancing,
and plunging at the meets, and subsequently
making an example of the
whole field.</p>

<p>The Major discovered, to his intense
disgust, that his stepson had got a wonderful
bargain—a prize he was resolved
to secure for himself on that young man’s
departure. “Clancy” was well aware
that his new owner was a strong bold
rider, who was his master; and, although
he was by no means a mount for a timid,
elderly gentleman, he was a mount for a
brave young lady, and Miss Dopping’s old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
face lit up with keen delight, when she
saw Betty Redmond, sitting squarely on
the grey, as he clattered up the town,
escorted by George on the Major’s dog-cart
mare, and Cuckoo on the blacksmith’s
pony. The grey was a rare
fencer in a big country, and sailed over
everything that came in his way, with
equal satisfaction to himself (for he had a
craze for fencing) and his rider; his performances
with the foxhounds were noted
by “The Man at the Cross Roads” in the
<i>Irish Times</i>, and the Major took extraordinary
credit to himself, as he attended
the meets on wheels, and flourished his
red silk pocket-handkerchief, and pointed
out his purchase to his friends, saying in
his loud hoarse voice:</p>

<p>“You see old Tom Malone has an
eye for a horse yet.” (All the same,
Tom Malone had never been credited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
with this particular class of eye, at any
period!)</p>

<p>“Look at that grey my stepson is
riding. <i>I</i> bought him, and dirt cheap
too. He can make a holy show of every
horse in the country; he is a chaser,
that’s what he is, and would fetch three
hundred any day. Eh? What? What?”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>George, with his hunter and his gun,
was now frequently absent from Ballingoole,
staying in various hospitable country
houses with recent acquaintances, with
relations of brother officers, or with hunting
men. His mother was gratified; she
“liked to see her bairn respected like
the lave.” The Major was gratified from
other reasons, and the only person who
was dissatisfied was Belle. Was her prize
to be snatched away from her, by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
hungry, scheming mothers of anxious
marriageable daughters?</p>

<p>Or would absence make his heart
grow fonder of her—or of somebody
else?</p>

<p>Early in February, the meet of the
Runmore foxhounds happened to be a
central one, and within two miles of
Ballingoole; this was always one of the
great events of the season, when all the
population, gentle and simple, turned out
<i>en masse</i>. The labourers had a holiday,
the townspeople closed their shops, and
every jaunting car and ass’s cart in the
parish, took the road to Drubberstown
Cross. Even Belle, who hated fox-hunting,
secured a seat in the Mahons’
wagonette. The Major was mounted in
his dog-cart, George on the grey, and
Denis on an elderly, but excellent black
mare belonging to the priest. Cuckoo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
and Betty (who knew every yard of the
country and always evinced a most active
interest in the Harriers) set out at an
early hour in Mrs. Malone’s donkey car;
indeed Betty had had a narrow escape of
figuring at the meet, with the bath-chair
at her heels, but Belle had not allowed
her mother to develop the idea. As long
as George Holroyd was in the country, the
old lady must forego such carriage exercise.
Astute Belle had gathered that he
disapproved of her turn-out, so Betty and
Cuckoo had driven off in a little village
cart, behind “Mookieanna,” a well-fed
sporting donkey—all three being in the
highest spirits. The young ladies had laid
their plans with much discrimination, and
resolved to relinquish the glories of the
meet, and to go instead, and take up a
strong position, from whence they would
be able to see the subsequent run—if run<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
there was. They drove straight to the
Hill of Knock, on the side of which lies
a neat gorse patch, a sure warrant for a
game fox. Tying Mookieanna to the
gate, they walked up through three large
bare fields to the cover side, and then
discovered, to their intense disgust, crowds
of country people assembled close to it,
smoking and joking, round several large
fires, awaiting the arrival of the hounds.</p>

<p>“It would be hard for them to find a
fox here to-day,” exclaimed Betty, breathless
and angry.</p>

<p>“Faix, and so it would, miss,” calmly
assented Mike, Mrs. Redmond’s handy
man and gardener. “Sure, didn’t I see
a brace of them break out of it this
morning, with my own two eyes, but I’m
thinking, maybe <i>himself</i> is in it yet.”</p>

<p>“There is no use in staying here,” said
Cuckoo scornfully. “They won’t find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
here, and will go on and draw Coolambar
Hill. We have plenty of time to run
across to it; it’s barely a mile-and-a-half by
the short cut. Mike, do you take home
the donkey, he is tied below at the gate.”</p>

<p>And the two girls girded up their
dresses, and fled down the hill, an exceedingly
active couple. “They ran like
hares,” to quote admirers round the cover
fires—they climbed, they jumped, they
struggled through hedges, with the ease
that came from youth, and health and
practice. As they were about to breast
Coolambar Hill, Betty paused suddenly
with a dramatic gesture, and said:</p>

<p>“Hush! Cuckoo. I <i>hear</i> them; they
have found!” and sure enough, their
listening ears caught the distant whimper
of hounds, now giving louder and louder
tongue.</p>

<p>Betty’s cheeks were scarlet with excitement,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
and even the pale Cuckoo was
moved.</p>

<p>“Here, Cuckoo, climb upon this wall,”
said her friend, dragging her forward as
she spoke, and nearly pulling her arms
out of their sockets; “we shall have a
splendid view.”</p>

<p>And on the top of the wall, they stood
hand in hand, panting from their recent
run, with their eyes eagerly bent on
Knock cover. Yes, here come the hounds
streaming down, half-a-dozen little white
specks, then the whole pack, then half-a-dozen
horsemen, then the whole field.</p>

<p>“Mike was right, you see he was at
home after all,” said Betty, “but oh! he
has been headed off by those sheep; he
won’t come here, he will go for Bresna
Wood, six miles away, if it’s an inch.”</p>

<p>The hounds passed in full cry, within
two fields of the girls, closely followed by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
the huntsman, a steeplechase rider, and a
spare-looking whip, on a bony chestnut
thoroughbred.</p>

<p>“Here is George,” cried Cuckoo,
triumphantly; “he is coming into this
field. Does not ‘Clancy’ jump beautifully?”
as the eager grey negotiated a
razor bank, between two deep though
narrow ditches.</p>

<p>“And just look at this man—riding
jealous”—as another horseman came at
the same fence at racing pace.</p>

<p>“Why it’s Ghosty Moore!”</p>

<p>The words had scarcely left her lips,
when a catastrophe cut short Ghosty’s
career. His horse, already blown and
over-ridden (but willing) took off too far,
failed to kick the bank, and fell back into
the near gripe, with a loud exclamation
from his rider. He and his horse were
both completely lost to sight; they had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
disappeared as suddenly as if the earth
had swallowed them. A shrill yell from
Cuckoo, piercing as a steam whistle,
caused her brother to turn his head, and
he beheld her running down the field,
waving her arms like a windmill gone
mad.</p>

<p>Of course he must stop; he pulled in
the grey with considerable difficulty, for
Clancy was bent on pursuing! He
would be furious if some nonsense of
Cuckoo’s cost him what looked like the
run of the season; he turned his horse,
and galloped up to her.</p>

<p>“What the deuce is the matter?” he
demanded impatiently.</p>

<p>“A man,” she gasped, “a man has
been killed,” pointing to the ditch, from
which there was neither sound nor sign.</p>

<p>George was on the spot in another five
seconds, and saw four shining, kicking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
hoofs, turned upwards, and heard a sickening
groan, as of one in mortal agony.</p>

<p>Here was a nice fix! Some fellow
under his horse, that horse jammed fast
in a narrow gripe ten feet deep, and
no one to help him, but a couple of
girls!</p>

<p>The hunt had passed to the left—swept
on with the inexorable determination
of foxhounds running a burning scent:
already there was not a soul to be seen,
for only the hard riders had come this
way—the less keen had taken to a convenient
lane. George was off the grey,
and down in the ditch, as quick as
thought. If he could only get the horse
lengthways, he might manage to drag
his rider from under him, but this was
impossible, single-handed. It looked a
serious business, and there was no time
to be lost.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span></p>

<p>“Come down, Cuckoo, like a good girl,”
he said coaxingly, “come down, and give
me a hand. There is no fear of you.
I’ll take care of that.”</p>

<p>Cuckoo peered down with a ghastly
face, and saw the struggling iron shoes,
the blood upon her brother’s gloves, and
heard half-stifled moans of anguish.</p>

<p>“I daren’t, George. Oh, I daren’t!”
and she began to cry.</p>

<p>“I dare, I am not afraid,” said Betty,
scrambling hastily into the ditch beside
him; “only tell me what I am to do.”</p>

<p>“I’ll manage the horse, if you can
move the man,” returned George. “Just
put your hands under his arms, very
firmly, and hold fast, and when I give
you the word, pull with all your strength—<i>now</i>.”</p>

<p>The experiment proved successful. Mr.
Moore was luckily a very light weight,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
and George Holroyd was a strong man,
otherwise he would have remained much
longer at the bottom of the ditch; but as
it was, after several attempts, these two
good Samaritans got him out between
them, and laid him on the grass—a truly
ghastly object; his head, which had come
in contact with a stone, was bleeding
profusely; his white face was streaked
with blood, and he seemed to be insensible.</p>

<p>George took off his coat, and folded it
up into a sort of pillow for the sufferer,
then he produced his flask, and endeavoured
to pour some of its contents between
his closed teeth.</p>

<p>“He is dead! Ghosty Moore is dead,”
shrieked Cuckoo, and she ran up the
field giving vent to a series of agonising
screams; she had no nerves whatever, and
the sight of blood made her sick and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
terrified. Yes, even the bold and saucy
Cuckoo! she was as useless as the grey,
who, with streaming reins, grazed greedily
along the hedge row, sublimely indifferent
to the fate of his companion, who was
struggling in the adjacent ditch. Presently
George went down and righted
him, and got him out, a limping terrified
spectacle, and then he said to Betty, who
had been trying to bind up the wounded
man’s head with their handkerchiefs:
“Some one must go for help at once,
either you or I!”</p>

<p>“There are no cottages near this, and
Ballingoole is four miles off. You had
better go; you will go faster,” she returned
promptly.</p>

<p>“But I don’t know the way,” he
replied.</p>

<p>“There is a lane at this gate, and if
the gate is locked, try a corner, there’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
sure to be a gap, and then turn to the
left, and keep straight out.”</p>

<p>“You are certain you don’t mind being
left here by yourself?” said George, pouring
some more sherry down the throat
of their unconscious patient; “you seem
to have made a good job with the bandages,
but I am afraid his arm is broken,
and he seems in a bad way—a very bad
way.”</p>

<p>They looked at one another gravely.</p>

<p>Supposing he were to die, with no one
by him but Betty?—for Cuckoo had
actually left the field, and was nowhere to
be seen.</p>

<p>“You must take your coat,” said the
girl, “and place his head in my lap; it
will answer as well, but before you go,
bring me some water in your hat.”</p>

<p>“Here it is,” he said, speedily returning
with his dripping property. “And I’ll fix<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
his saddle for you to sit on, instead of
this wet field.”</p>

<p>“No, please don’t,” she vainly remonstrated,
“there is no time to lose, you
must not think of <i>me</i>.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless George thought a good deal
about Betty, as he galloped into Ballingoole,
in search of Dr. Moran. What a
brave girl she was, remaining there alone,
with, for all they knew, a dying man. She
was just the sort of girl to stand beside
one at a pinch; now he came to think of
it, her face was of the heroic type. As to
Cuckoo! he scarcely dared to let his mind
dwell on his shameless hysterical young
relative, whom he presently overtook proceeding
homewards at a kind of shambling
run.</p>

<p>“Cuckoo!” he called out sternly, “I
am ashamed of you.”</p>

<p>“I am going for help,” sobbed Cuckoo,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
who was what is known among the lower
orders as “roaring and crying.” “Is—is—he
dead yet?”</p>

<p>“Go to the first cabin you come across,
and borrow a door and a blanket,” shouted
her brother, and then pushed on, and was
so expeditious, that within an hour the
wounded man had been removed from the
scene of his accident, and conveyed home
carefully in the charge of Dr. Moran.
Augustus Moore, nick-named “Ghosty,”
on account of his white face, lint locks, and
spare figure, was the eldest son of Colonel
Moore of Roskeen, a county magnate, who
possessed not only lands, but money. He
had been accustomed to see Betty Redmond
ever since she was a small child, and he
liked her, but something stronger than mere
liking awoke in his bosom, when he came
to his senses, and found himself lying
with his head in Betty’s lap at the foot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
of Coolambar Hill. He was so stunned,
and bruised, and weak, that he firmly
believed that he had entered on his last
hour; but Betty’s presence cheered him.
She bathed his face, moistened his dry
lips, restored his confidence, and gave him
heart in one sense, whilst she took it
away in another.</p>

<p>As he lay there, helpless, between sod
and sky, with her sympathetic voice in his
ears, her sweet anxious face bent over his,
he made up his mind, that if he lived, he
would like to marry Betty Redmond.
This was a curious coincidence, for George
Holroyd, as he walked home beside her,
that grey wintry afternoon, four long
miles through muddy roads and lanes,
with “Clancy’s” bridle over his arm, had
almost come to the same conclusion. At
any rate, he told himself that she was the
prettiest, pluckiest, and nicest girl it had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
ever been his luck to know. However
an immediate visit to the other side of
the county, drew him away from Betty’s
unexpected fascinations—and they did not
meet again for many weeks.</p>
